For instance, Mao et al. (2019) generates story with multitasking learning on commonsense QA datasets. Zhao et al. (2020) used BERT as a knowledge selection module for dialogue generation. Chakrabarty et al. (2020) ranked knowledge generated from the COMET for sarcasm generation. Ji et al. (2020) do multi-hop with a graph convolutional network on ConceptNet.

This relatedness reflects two "higher order" conflicts: (1) openness to change/own thoughts vs. conservation/submission, and (2) self-transcension (directed towards others/the environment) vs. self-enhancing (directed towards one's self), allowing to analyse values at several levels. Cheng and Fleischmann (2010) consolidates 12 schemes into a "meta-inventory" with 16 values, such as honesty and justice, revealing a large overlap in schemes across fields of research.

Feldman (2021) recently showed the strong connection between values and the moral foundation theory (Haidt, 2012). Like personal values, this theory analyzes ethical reasoning behind human choices, but considers five rather abstract "foundations:" care, fairness, loyalty, authority, and purity. Alshomary and Wachsmuth (2021) hypothesized that the foundations could be used for audiencespecific argument generation. Kobbe et al. (2020) tried to classify arguments by foundations, but noted a low human agreement due to the vagueness of the foundations.

Following the taxonomy in (Liu et al., 2021), these methods can be classified depending on whether the language models' parameters are tuned and on whether trainable prompts are introduced. Our method belongs to the category that fixes the prompts and tune the language models' parameters. Despite the flourish of the research in prompting methods, there is only limited attention being put on multilingual tasks (Winata et al., 2021).

The retriever aims at retrieving supportive passages to the given question from a large document corpus. The reader intends to find answer of the question from the first stage retrieved passages.

  and Lewis et al. (2020a) concatenate the given question with top retrieved passages and feed the concatenation to the BART model (Lewis et al., 2019). Izacard and Grave (2020b) separately encodes the question with each top retrieved passage, then takes the concatenation of the encoder outputs as input to the decoder. Their method provide a way to better aggregate evidence from multiple passages and improve the performance significantly. FiD-KD (Izacard and Grave, 2020a) is an extension of FiD model that increases the accuracy of passage retrieval by training the dense retriever with the guidance of the FiD reader iteratively.

Several of the value schemes proposed in the literature pertain to specific purposes. England (1967) suggested 66 values related to management decisions, such as high productivity and prestige, and categorized them by relevant entity, for example business organizations and individuals. Brown and Crace (2002) looked at 14 values for counseling and therapy, such as responsibility and spirituality, and Kahle et al. (1988) at nine for consumer research, such as warm relationships and excitement.


[1365-2035] Lacks synthesis, File: paper_2.txt,  Coder: default
Other proposed value schemes are more generic. Combining research from anthropology, sociology, philosophy, and psychology, Rokeach (1973) estimates the total number of human values to be fewer than hundreds, and develops a practical survey of 36 values that distinguishes between values pertaining to desirable end states and desirable behavior. Specifically for cross-cultural analyses, Schwartz et al. ( 2012) derived 48 value questions from the universal needs of individuals and societies, including obeying all the laws and to be humble. Moreover, Schwartz (1994) proposes a relatedness of values by their tendency to be compatible in their pursuit (see Figure 1).

There are growing interests recently to incorporate prompts on pre-trained language models in order to guide the models' behavior or elicit knowledge (Shin et al., 2020;Schick and Schütze, 2021;Qin and Eisner, 2021;Scao and Rush, 2021).

Following the work of DrQA (Chen et al., 2017), most recent works build a two-stage retriever-reader system to tackle the problem. The retriever aims at retrieving supportive passages to the given question from a large document corpus. The reader intends to find answer of the question from the first stage retrieved passages. Early work of Chen et al. (2017) adapts a BiLSTM architecture with various lexical and semantic features from the question and passages as inputs. Later, with the emergence of large-scale pre-trained language models, readers based on pre-trained models such as BERT and T5 Raffel et al., 2019) have become a common approach (Yang et al., 2019;Karpukhin et al., 2020;Izacard and Grave, 2020b).

Compared to extractive models which extract existing words from the retrieved passages, generative models are able to produce new words out of the retrieved passages, and thus provide a more flexible modeling framework.  and Lewis et al. (2020a) concatenate the given question with top retrieved passages and feed the concatenation to the BART model (Lewis et al., 2019). Izacard and Grave (2020b) separately encodes the question with each top retrieved passage, then takes the concatenation of the encoder outputs as input to the decoder.

Data-based Transfer Translating utterances for the intent classification task is relatively straightforward so previous works focused on projecting and/or aligning the entity labels between translated utterances (Dou and Neubig, 2021). This technique is followed by standard supervised training with those pseudo-labels and is commonly known as a translate-train method. One of the earliest works still being used for this purpose is fastalign (Dyer et al., 2013). It's an unsupervised word aligner trained on a parallel corpus to map each word (thus its entity label) in the source utterance to the word(s) in the target user utterance. Projecting the entity labels can also be done with word-by-word translation and source label copying (Yi and Cheng, 2021). A teacher model then weakly labels the target data, which is used to train the final student model. Sometimes, this type of label projection is complemented with an additional entity alignment step (Li et al., 2021a). Better performance can be achieved by using machine translation with entity matching and distributional statistics (Jain et al., 2019) though this can be a costly process for each language. A category of 'word substitution' methods such as code-switching (Qin et al., 2020;Kuwanto et al., 2021) or dictionary-enhanced pretraining  have also been shown to improve cross-lingual transfer.

However, previous speech pre-training work suffers from two problems: (1) most of them learn the speech representation with only unlabeled speech data but ignore the importance of textual data to spoken language tasks (e.g., automatic speech recognition) which require the modality transformation; (2) most of these models solely rely on a pre-trained speech encoder for various downstream tasks, leaving the decoder not pre-trained for the sequence-to-sequence generation tasks.

A common issue occurs that can potentially impact the validity of results is filtering the set of systems to be evaluated via automatic metric scores.


[181-386] Unsupported claim, File: paper_4.txt,  Coder: default
Since metric scores are known to be a poor substitute for human assessment, this only results in the pos-sibility that the best system according to human judges is inadvertently filtered out at this stage.

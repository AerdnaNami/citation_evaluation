[741-1101] Coherence, File: paper_1.txt,  Coder: default
For instance, Mao et al. (2019) generates story with multitasking learning on commonsense QA datasets. Zhao et al. (2020) used BERT as a knowledge selection module for dialogue generation. Chakrabarty et al. (2020) ranked knowledge generated from the COMET for sarcasm generation. Ji et al. (2020) do multi-hop with a graph convolutional network on ConceptNet.

Feldman (2021) recently showed the strong connection between values and the moral foundation theory (Haidt, 2012). Like personal values, this theory analyzes ethical reasoning behind human choices, but considers five rather abstract "foundations:" care, fairness, loyalty, authority, and purity. Alshomary and Wachsmuth (2021) hypothesized that the foundations could be used for audiencespecific argument generation. Kobbe et al. (2020) tried to classify arguments by foundations, but noted a low human agreement due to the vagueness of the foundations. We assume values can here contribute to the classification by foundations.

The retriever aims at retrieving supportive passages to the given question from a large document corpus. The reader intends to find answer of the question from the first stage retrieved passages. Early work of Chen et al. (2017) adapts a BiLSTM architecture with various lexical and semantic features from the question and passages as inputs.

Several of the value schemes proposed in the literature pertain to specific purposes. England (1967) suggested 66 values related to management decisions, such as high productivity and prestige, and categorized them by relevant entity, for example business organizations and individuals. Brown and Crace (2002) looked at 14 values for counseling and therapy, such as responsibility and spirituality, and Kahle et al. (1988) at nine for consumer research, such as warm relationships and excitement.

Other proposed value schemes are more generic. Combining research from anthropology, sociology, philosophy, and psychology, Rokeach (1973) estimates the total number of human values to be fewer than hundreds, and develops a practical survey of 36 values that distinguishes between values pertaining to desirable end states and desirable behavior. Specifically for cross-cultural analyses, Schwartz et al. ( 2012) derived 48 value questions from the universal needs of individuals and societies, including obeying all the laws and to be humble. Moreover, Schwartz (1994) proposes a relatedness of values by their tendency to be compatible in their pursuit (see Figure 1). This relatedness reflects two "higher order" conflicts: (1) openness to change/own thoughts vs. conservation/submission, and (2) self-transcension (directed towards others/the environment) vs. self-enhancing (directed towards one's self), allowing to analyse values at several levels. Cheng and Fleischmann (2010) consolidates 12 schemes into a "meta-inventory" with 16 values, such as honesty and justice, revealing a large overlap in schemes across fields of research. However, as the meta-inventory is strictly more coarse-grained than Schwartz et al.'s theory we do not investigate it further for this paper.

Following the work of DrQA (Chen et al., 2017), most recent works build a two-stage retriever-reader system to tackle the problem. The retriever aims at retrieving supportive passages to the given question from a large document corpus. The reader intends to find answer of the question from the first stage retrieved passages. Early work of Chen et al. (2017) adapts a BiLSTM architecture with various lexical and semantic features from the question and passages as inputs. Later, with the emergence of large-scale pre-trained language models, readers based on pre-trained models such as BERT and T5 Raffel et al., 2019) have become a common approach (Yang et al., 2019;Karpukhin et al., 2020;Izacard and Grave, 2020b).

Compared to extractive models which extract existing words from the retrieved passages, generative models are able to produce new words out of the retrieved passages, and thus provide a more flexible modeling framework.  and Lewis et al. (2020a) concatenate the given question with top retrieved passages and feed the concatenation to the BART model (Lewis et al., 2019). Izacard and Grave (2020b) separately encodes the question with each top retrieved passage, then takes the concatenation of the encoder outputs as input to the decoder. Their method provide a way to better aggregate evidence from multiple passages and improve the performance significantly. FiD-KD (Izacard and Grave, 2020a) is an extension of FiD model that increases the accuracy of passage retrieval by training the dense retriever with the guidance of the FiD reader iteratively.

This is primarily because the datasets are not typically structured around the specific dimensions of reading comprehension sub-skills, nor do they provide sufficient information on what sub-skills are tested.


[1785-1992] Unsupported claim, File: paper_10.txt,  Coder: default
This issue is compounded by the fact that many benchmarks rely on crowd-sourced workers who may not have sufficient training or education domain knowledge needed to create valid questions in a onsistent way.

However, previous speech pre-training work suffers from two problems: (1) most of them learn the speech representation with only unlabeled speech data but ignore the importance of textual data to spoken language tasks (e.g., automatic speech recognition) which require the modality transformation; (2) most of these models solely rely on a pre-trained speech encoder for various downstream tasks, leaving the decoder not pre-trained for the sequence-to-sequence generation tasks.

A common issue occurs that can potentially impact the validity of results is filtering the set of systems to be evaluated via automatic metric scores


[579-726] Unsupported claim, File: paper_4.txt,  Coder: default
while similarly in the sixth Dialog System Technology Challenge (DSTC6) systems were filtered according to metric scores prior to human evaluation.

In terms of the live evaluation, competitions such as Convai2 report such evaluations as highly challenging, with many of the resulting dialogues reported to be senseless, offensive, or simply not in line with instructions and ultimately live evaluation results have been discarded.

On the other hand, competitions that (for one reason or another) do not release data and evaluation techniques into the public domain have reported relative success in terms of human evaluation.

The first Amazon Alexa Socialbot Grand Challenge required human assessors to score how coherent and engaging conversations were on a 1-5 rating scale by two distinct groups: volunteer Amazon employees (experts), and general Alexa users (crowds) (Ram et al., 2018), are reported to achieve a correlation of overall scores for the two types of human assessors at 0.93.

Several approaches to zero-shot cross-lingual transfer exist and can broadly be divided into: a) Databased Transfer, which focuses on training data transformation and b) Model-based Transfer that centres around modifying models' training routine.

This technique is followed by standard supervised training with those pseudo-labels and is commonly known as a translate-train method

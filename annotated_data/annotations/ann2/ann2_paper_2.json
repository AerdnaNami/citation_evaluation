        "full_text": "Background\n\nHuman values are of concern to most if not to all social sciences (Rokeach, 1973) and have also been integrated into computational frameworks of argumentation (Bench-Capon, 2003). In NLP, values have been analyzed for personality profiling (Maheshwari et al., 2017), but not yet for argument mining, as considered here.\n\nValues in Social Science\n\nRokeach (1973) already described the two concepts of (1) a value as a belief pertaining to desirable end states or modes of conduct and (2) a value system as prioritization of values based on cultural, social, and personal factors. These definitions attribute values to persons rather than to objects, facilitating a systematic analysis (Rokeach, 1973). The paper at hand targets the personal values behind arguments, meaning the values in the former sense that the arguments, mostly implicitly, resort to.\n\nSeveral of the value schemes proposed in the literature pertain to specific purposes. England (1967) suggested 66 values related to management decisions, such as high productivity and prestige, and categorized them by relevant entity, for example business organizations and individuals. Brown and Crace (2002) looked at 14 values for counseling and therapy, such as responsibility and spirituality, and Kahle et al. (1988) at nine for consumer research, such as warm relationships and excitement.\n\nOther proposed value schemes are more generic. Combining research from anthropology, sociology, philosophy, and psychology, Rokeach (1973) estimates the total number of human values to be fewer than hundreds, and develops a practical survey of 36 values that distinguishes between values pertaining to desirable end states and desirable behavior. Specifically for cross-cultural analyses, Schwartz et al. ( 2012) derived 48 value questions from the universal needs of individuals and societies, including obeying all the laws and to be humble. Moreover, Schwartz (1994) proposes a relatedness of values by their tendency to be compatible in their pursuit (see Figure 1). This relatedness reflects two \"higher order\" conflicts: (1) openness to change/own thoughts vs. conservation/submission, and (2) self-transcension (directed towards others/the environment) vs. self-enhancing (directed towards one's self), allowing to analyse values at several levels. Cheng and Fleischmann (2010) consolidates 12 schemes into a \"meta-inventory\" with 16 values, such as honesty and justice, revealing a large overlap in schemes across fields of research. However, as the meta-inventory is strictly more coarse-grained than Schwartz et al.'s theory we do not investigate it further for this paper.\n\nValues in Argumentation Research\n\nFormal argumentation employs value systems to model audience-specific preferences, that is, an argument's strength depends on the degree to which the audience reveres the values the argument resorts to. Examples include value-based argumentation schemes (van der Weide et al., 2009), defeasible logic programming (Teze et al., 2019), and the value-based argumentation framework of Bench-Capon (2003). The latter is an extension of the abstract argumentation framework of Dung (1995) that has already been applied manually to analyze interactions with reasoning and persuasion subject to a specific value system (Atkinson and Bench-Capon, 2021). This paper present a first step towards the large-scale automatic application of these works as it takes values to argument mining. Feldman (2021) recently showed the strong connection between values and the moral foundation theory (Haidt, 2012). Like personal values, this theory analyzes ethical reasoning behind human choices, but considers five rather abstract \"foundations:\" care, fairness, loyalty, authority, and purity. Alshomary and Wachsmuth (2021) hypothesized that the foundations could be used for audiencespecific argument generation. Kobbe et al. (2020) tried to classify arguments by foundations, but noted a low human agreement due to the vagueness of the foundations. We assume values can here contribute to the classification by foundations.\n\nPartly, values overlap with ideas of framing in communication, that is, the selection and emphasis of specific aspects of (perceived) reality to promote a particular problem definition, causal interpretation, ethical evaluation, and/or recommendation (Entman, 1993). In frames, values can define the costs and benefits of options (Entman, 1993) whereas common value systems are used for evaluation. Frames have been studied computationally for news (Naderi and Hirst, 2015), political speech (De Vreese, 2005), and argumentation (Ajjour et al., 2019). In argumentation, some values are so prevalent that they constitute frames of their own, indicating a potential use of values in frame identification. For example, 14 of the 54 values we use in this work are also frames in the dataset of Ajjour et al. 1 Values may be considered as aspects under which to group arguments. Some researchers have mined aspects from text (Trautmann, 2020) or used them to control argument generation (Schiller et al., 2021). Others have studied the task of opinion summarization in arguments (Egan et al., 2016;Misra et al., 2016;Chen et al., 2019), aiming at the most important aspects discussed in a debate. Related, the task of key point analysis (Bar-Haim et al., 2020;Friedman et al., 2021) is to generate a small set of concise statements that each represent a different aspect. We argue that analyzing the values found in a collection of arguments provides a new perspective to aspects in argumentation, focusing on the \"why\" behind an argument's reasoning.\n\n References: \nAjjour, Y., Alshomary, M., Wachsmuth, H., and Stein, B. 2019.

        "full_text": "Background\n\nHuman values are of concern to most if not to all social sciences (Rokeach, 1973) and have also been integrated into computational frameworks of argumentation (Bench-Capon, 2003). In NLP, values have been analyzed for personality profiling (Maheshwari et al., 2017), but not yet for argument mining, as considered here.\n\nValues in Social Science\n\nRokeach (1973) already described the two concepts of (1) a value as a belief pertaining to desirable end states or modes of conduct and (2) a value system as prioritization of values based on cultural, social, and personal factors. These definitions attribute values to persons rather than to objects, facilitating a systematic analysis (Rokeach, 1973). The paper at hand targets the personal values behind arguments, meaning the values in the former sense that the arguments, mostly implicitly, resort to.\n\nSeveral of the value schemes proposed in the literature pertain to specific purposes. England (1967) suggested 66 values related to management decisions, such as high productivity and prestige, and categorized them by relevant entity, for example business organizations and individuals. Brown and Crace (2002) looked at 14 values for counseling and therapy, such as responsibility and spirituality, and Kahle et al. (1988) at nine for consumer research, such as warm relationships and excitement.\n\nOther proposed value schemes are more generic.

Moreover, Schwartz (1994) proposes a relatedness of values by their tendency to be compatible in their pursuit (see Figure 1). This relatedness reflects two \"higher order\" conflicts: (1) openness to change/own thoughts vs. conservation/submission, and (2) self-transcension (directed towards others/the environment) vs. self-enhancing (directed towards one's self), allowing to analyse values at several levels. Cheng and Fleischmann (2010) consolidates 12 schemes into a \"meta-inventory\" with 16 values, such as honesty and justice, revealing a large overlap in schemes across fields of research. However, as the meta-inventory is strictly more coarse-grained than Schwartz et al.'s theory we do not investigate it further for this paper.\n\nValues in Argumentation Research\n\nFormal argumentation employs value systems to model audience-specific preferences, that is, an argument's strength depends on the degree to which the audience reveres the values the argument resorts to. Examples include value-based argumentation schemes (van der Weide et al., 2009), defeasible logic programming (Teze et al., 2019), and the value-based argumentation framework of Bench-Capon (2003). The latter is an extension of the abstract argumentation framework of Dung (1995) that has already been applied manually to analyze interactions with reasoning and persuasion subject to a specific value system (Atkinson and Bench-Capon, 2021). This paper present a first step towards the large-scale automatic application of these works as it takes values to argument mining. Feldman (2021) recently showed the strong connection between values and the moral foundation theory (Haidt, 2012). Like personal values, this theory analyzes ethical reasoning behind human choices, but considers five rather abstract \"foundations:\" care, fairness, loyalty, authority, and purity. Alshomary and Wachsmuth (2021) hypothesized that the foundations could be used for audiencespecific argument generation. Kobbe et al. (2020) tried to classify arguments by foundations, but noted a low human agreement due to the vagueness of the foundations. We assume values can here contribute to the classification by foundations.\n\nPartly, values overlap with ideas of framing in communication, that is, the selection and emphasis of specific aspects of (perceived) reality to promote a particular problem definition, causal interpretation, ethical evaluation, and/or recommendation (Entman, 1993). In frames, values can define the costs and benefits of options (Entman, 1993) whereas common value systems are used for evaluation. Frames have been studied computationally for news (Naderi and Hirst, 2015), political speech (De Vreese, 2005), and argumentation (Ajjour et al., 2019). In argumentation, some values are so prevalent that they constitute frames of their own, indicating a potential use of values in frame identification. For example, 14 of the 54 values we use in this work are also frames in the dataset of Ajjour et al. 1 Values may be considered as aspects under which to group arguments. Some researchers have mined aspects from text (Trautmann, 2020) or used them to control argument generation (Schiller et al., 2021). Others have studied the task of opinion summarization in arguments (Egan et al., 2016;Misra et al., 2016;Chen et al., 2019), aiming at the most important aspects discussed in a debate. Related, the task of key point analysis (Bar-Haim et al., 2020;Friedman et al., 2021) is to generate a small set of concise statements that each represent a different aspect. We argue that analyzing the values found in a collection of arguments provides a new perspective to aspects in argumentation, focusing on the \"why\" behind an argument's reasoning.\n\n References: \nAjjour, Y., Alshomary, M., Wachsmuth, H., and Stein, B. 2019.

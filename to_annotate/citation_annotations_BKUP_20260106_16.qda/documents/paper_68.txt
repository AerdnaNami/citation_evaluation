Introduction

Law is a field of human endeavor dominated by the use of language. As part of their professional training, law students consume large bodies of text as they seek to tune their understanding of the law and its application to help manage human behavior. Virtually every modern legal system produces massive volumes of textual data (Katz et al., 2020). Lawyers, judges, and regulators continuously author legal documents such as briefs, memos, statutes, regulations, contracts, patents and judicial decisions (Coupette et al., 2021). Beyond the consumption and production of language, law and the art of lawyering is also an exercise centered around the analysis and interpretation of text.

Natural language understanding (NLU) technologies can assist legal practitioners in a variety of legal tasks (Chalkidis and Kampas, 2018;Aletras et al., 2019Aletras et al., , 2020Zhong et al., 2020b;   (Aletras et al., 2016;Sim et al., 2016;Katz et al., 2017;Zhong et al., 2018;Chalkidis et al., 2019a;Malik et al., 2021), information extraction from legal documents (Chalkidis et al., , 2019cChen et al., 2020;Hendrycks et al., 2021) and case summarization (Bhattacharya et al., 2019) to legal question answering (Ravichander et al., 2019;Kien et al., 2020;Zhong et al., 2020a,c) and text classification (Nallapati and Manning, 2008;Chalkidis et al., 2019bChalkidis et al., , 2020a. Transformer models (Vaswani et al., 2017) pre-trained on legal, rather than generic, corpora have also been studied (Chalkidis et al., 2020b;Zheng et al., 2021;.

Pre-trained Transformers, including BERT (Devlin et al., 2019), GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020), T5 (Raffel et al., 2020), BART (Lewis et al., 2020), DeBERTa (He et al., 2021) and numerous variants, are currently the state of the art in most natural language processing (NLP) tasks. Rapid performance improvements have been witnessed, to the extent that ambitious multi-task benchmarks (Wang et al., 2018(Wang et al., , 2019b are considered almost 'solved' a few years after their release and need to be made more challenging (Wang et al., 2019a). Recently, Bommasani et al. (2021) named these pre-trained models (e.g., BERT, DALL-E, GPT-3) foundation models. The term may be controversial, but it emphasizes the paradigm shift these models have caused and their interdisciplinary potential. Studying the latter includes the question of how to adapt these models to legal text . As discussed by Zhong et al. (2020b) and Chalkidis et al. (2020b), legal text has distinct characteristics, such as terms that are uncommon in generic corpora (e.g., 'restrictive covenant', 'promissory estoppel', 'tort', 'novation'), terms that have different senses than in everyday language (e.g., an 'executed' contract is signed and effective, a 'party' is a legal entity), older expressions (e.g., pronominal adverbs like 'herein', 'hereto', 'wherefore'), uncommon expressions from other languages (e.g., 'laches', 'voir dire', 'certiorari', 'sub judice'), and long sentences with unusual word order (e.g., "the provisions for termination hereinafter appearing or will at the cost of the borrower forthwith comply with the same") to the extent that legal language is often classified as a 'sublanguage' (Tiersma, 1999;Williams, 2007;Haigh, 2018). Furthermore, legal documents are often much longer than the maximum length state-ofthe-art deep learning models can handle, including those designed to handle long text (Beltagy et al., 2020;Zaheer et al., 2020;Yang et al., 2020).

Inspired by the recent widespread use of the GLUE multi-task benchmark NLP dataset (Wang et al., 2018(Wang et al., , 2019b, the subsequent more difficult SuperGLUE (Wang et al., 2019a), other previous multi-task NLP benchmarks (Conneau and Kiela, 2018;McCann et al., 2018), and similar initiatives in other domains (Peng et al., 2019), we introduce LexGLUE, a benchmark dataset to evaluate the performance of NLP methods in legal tasks. LexGLUE is based on seven English existing legal NLP datasets, selected using criteria largely from SuperGLUE (discussed in Section 3.1).

We anticipate that more datasets, tasks, and languages will be added in later versions of LexGLUE. 1 As more legal NLP datasets become available, we also plan to favor datasets checked thoroughly for validity (scores reflecting real-life performance), annotation quality, statistical power, and social bias (Bowman and Dahl, 2021).

As in GLUE and SuperGLUE (Wang et al., 2019b,a), one of our goals is to push towards generic (or 'foundation') models that can cope with multiple NLP tasks, in our case legal NLP tasks, possibly with limited task-specific fine-tuning. Another goal is to provide a convenient and informative entry point for NLP researchers and practitioners wishing to explore or develop methods for legal NLP. Having these goals in mind, the datasets we include in LexGLUE and the tasks they address have been simplified in several ways, discussed below, to make it easier for newcomers and generic models to address all tasks. We provide Python APIs integrated with Hugging Face (Wolf et al., 2020;Lhoest et al., 2021) to easily import all the datasets we experiment with and evaluate the performance of different models (Section 5.3). By unifying and facilitating the access to a set of law-related datasets and tasks, we hope to attract not only more NLP experts, but also more interdisciplinary researchers (e.g., law doctoral students willing to take NLP courses). More broadly, we hope LexGLUE will speed up the adoption and transparent evaluation of new legal NLP methods and approaches in the commercial sector too. Indeed, there have been many commercial press releases in the legal-tech industry on high-performing systems, but almost no independent evaluation of the performance of machine learning and NLPbased tools. A standard publicly available benchmark would also allay concerns of undue influence in predictive models, including the use of metadata which the relevant law expressly disregards.

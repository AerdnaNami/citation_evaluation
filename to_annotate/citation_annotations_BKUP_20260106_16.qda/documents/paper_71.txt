Introduction

Contextualized embedding algorithms, such as BERT (Devlin et al., 2019), have achieved impressive performance on a wide variety of tasks (Huang et al., 2019;Chan and Fan, 2019;Yoosuf and Yang, 2019). One application of BERT is as a measure of sentence similarity (Zhang et al., 2019;Sellam et al., 2020), based on the assumption that BERT will produce similar representations for the words in two sentences with similar semantics.

We propose to use paraphrases with alignments between words as a tool for studying how BERT represents words and phrases. Figure 1 shows an example. Critically, when considering an aligned word pair, we can assume the context has a similar impact on both words because we know the phrases are semantically similar. Previously, paraphrases have been used to probe whether compositionality is accurately captured by BERT (Yu and Ettinger, 2020), but we believe they can be used to explore many other questions.

Using the Paraphrase Database (Pavlick et al., 2015), we explore how consistent contextual representations are when controlling for the semantics of the context. We find that BERT does consistently represent phrases that are paraphrases. Looking at words, BERT effectively handles variation in spelling, but does less well with spelling errors. BERT effectively handles words of varying levels of polysemy, but the representations for synonyms are surprisingly diverse, with a much broader distribution of similarity scores. These findings confirm results from prior work using other methods, while revealing new details.

We also consider a range of other models' word representations, finding that they have similar patterns to BERT, but with words that are the same and aligned receiving even more consistent representations than from BERT. BERT gives less contextualized representations to paraphrased words than non-paraphrased words, with the exception of punctuation. Finally, we re-evaluate work looking at patterns across BERT's layers and find that when controlling for semantics the later layers actually produce more similar representations (in contrast to previous work).

These results show that paraphrases are a useful tool for studying representations. By controlling for meaning while presenting interesting surface variations, they provide a unique probe of behavior.

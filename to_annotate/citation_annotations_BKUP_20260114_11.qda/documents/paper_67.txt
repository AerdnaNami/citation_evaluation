The standard practice of using BERT is fine-tuning, i.e. the entirety of the model parameters is adjusted on the training corpus of the downstream task, so that the model is adapted to that specific task (Devlin et al., 2019). There is also an alternative feature-based approach, used by ELMo (Peters et al., 2018). In the latter approach, the pre-trained model is regarded as a feature extractor with frozen parameters. During the learning of a downstream task, one feeds a fixed or learnable combination of the model's intermediate representations as input to the task-specific module, and only the parameters of the latter will be updated. It has been shown that the fine-tuning approach is generally superior to the feature-based approach for BERT in terms of task performance (Devlin et al., 2019;Peters et al., 2019).

A natural middle ground between these two approaches is partial fine-tuning, i.e. only fine-tuning some topmost layers of BERT while keeping the remaining bottom layers frozen. This approach has been studied in (Houlsby et al., 2019;Merchant et al., 2020), where the authors observed that finetuning only the top layers can almost achieve the performance of full fine-tuning on several GLUE tasks. The approach of partial fine-tuning essentially regards the bottom layers of BERT as a feature extractor. Freezing weights from bottom layers is a sensible idea as previous studies show that the mid layer representations produced by BERT are most transferrable, whereas the top layers representations are more task-oriented (Wang et al., 2019;Tenney et al., 2019b,a;Merchant et al., 2020).

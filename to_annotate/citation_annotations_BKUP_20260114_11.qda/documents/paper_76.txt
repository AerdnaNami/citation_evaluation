Template-based data generation has been previously used for data augmentation, for example to inject numerical skills (Geva et al., 2020), and to improve consistency (Asai and Hajishirzi, 2020), and zero-shot accuracy (Zhao et al., 2019). In addition, templates were used for dataset construction (Talmor and Berant, 2018;Thorne et al., 2021), and to analyse model generalization (Rozen et al., 2019). In this work, we automatically generate examples by instantiating templates using structured data. Since our method relies solely on tables as input, it is highly scalable, has rich lexical diversity, and can be easily extended to new skills and domains.

Recently, Thorne et al. ( 2021) introduced the WIKINLDB dataset, which includes queries that require reasoning over a set of textual facts. Queries are instantiated with values from a knowledge graph (KG), and facts are generated by a LM. Unlike this work, WIKINLDB is focused on evaluating reasoning skills. We, on the other hand, show that generated examples can be used to endow a pretrained LM with new reasoning skills. Moreover, tables are much easier to collect at scale compared to KGs, which tend to have limited coverage. Data augmenatation techniques have been extensively explored in RC, QA, and dialogue (Feng refers to all questions that do not require reasoning over the image modality.     Khashabi et al., 2020;Alberti et al., 2019;Puri et al., 2020;Bartolo et al., 2021). Here, we focus on tables as a valuable source for data generation.

Pre-training over tables has focused in the past on reasoning over tables and knowledge-bases Yin et al., 2020;Herzig et al., 2020;Müller et al., 2021;Yu et al., 2021;Neeraja et al., 2021b). Here, we use pre-training over tables to improve reasoning over text. We leave evaluation on tasks beyond RC to future work.

Error-driven sampling has been considered in the past in the context of active learning (Sharma et al., 2018), reinforcement learning (Graves et al., 2017;Glover and Hokamp, 2019;Xu et al., 2019), transfer learning Pilault et al., 2021), and distributionally robust optimization (Oren et al., 2019;Sagawa et al., 2020), where the goal is to perform well over a family of distributions. Similar to Gottumukkala et al. (2020), we compute heterogeneous batches based on error rates, and show that this improves efficiency and performance.

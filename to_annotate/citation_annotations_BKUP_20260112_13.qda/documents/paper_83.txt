There is an important line of work that focuses on claim verification. This includes techniques that predict the veracity of a claim based on the text of the claim only (Rashkin et al., 2017), linguistic features (Popat et al., 2017), meta information about the claimant (e.g., name, job, party affiliation, veracity history) (Wang, 2017b), review articles (Augenstein et al., 2019;Shu et al., 2018;Nakov et al., 2021), as well as relevant articles returned by a search engine (Popat et al., 2018;Augenstein et al., 2019;Mishra and Setty, 2019). To the best of our knowledge, none of the existing work considers the problem of claim verification based on premise articles. There is an important distinction between articles returned by a search engine in previous work and the premise articles that we consider. The techniques that use a search engine to find articles related to a claim query the search engine after a fact checking website has published a review article and therefore end up retrieving articles that include the review article as well as other articles that summarize and/or discuss the verdict of the fact checking website. Hence they are tackling an entailment problem. In contrast, the premise articles that we consider are the source articles used by a fact checker before publishing a review article. Those articles contain relevant facts, but not a summary or discussion of the review article since they are published before the review article and in fact serve as premises for the review article.

Closely related to claim verification is the problem of fake news detection. In this problem, the credibility of an entire news article is evaluated. The credibility of a news article can be estimated based on linguistic and textual features (Conroy et al., 2015;Reis et al., 2019;Li et al., 2019), discourse level structure (Karimi and Tang, 2019), network analysis (Conroy et al., 2015), knowledge graphs (Cui et al., 2020), inter-user behaviour dynamics (Gangireddy et al., 2020) or a combination of multiple modalities . Some techniques reorder the articles returned by a search engine based on their degree of credibility (Olteanu et al., 2013;Beylunioglu, 2020). An important task that can help the detection of fake news is the task of stance detection (Borges et al., 2019;Jwa et al., 2019), i.e., does the content of an article agree or disagree with the title of the article? The following surveys summarize existing work on fake news detection: (Kumar and Shah, 2018;Bondielli and Marcelloni, 2019).

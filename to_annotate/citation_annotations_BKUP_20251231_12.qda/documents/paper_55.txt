Introduction

While many information seeking questions can be answered by a short text span, requiring a short span answer significantly limits the types of questions that can be addressed as well as the extent of information that can be conveyed. Recent work (Fan et al., 2019;Krishna et al., 2021) explored long form answers, where answers can be free-form texts consisting of multiple sentences. Their multi-sentence nature leads to interesting and nuanced discourse within the answers, where the answerer can provide information, hedge, explain, provide examples, point to other sources, and more. Answerers can flexibly structure and organize these elements to provide a coherent, concise answer.

The complexity and flexibility of long form answers pose fresh challenges to the evaluation of long form question answering systems, in stark contrast to short span-based answers where matching spans (Rajpurkar et al., 2016;Joshi et al., 2017) provides a reliable proxy. A recent study (Krishna et al., 2021) demonstrated that automatic metrics like ROUGE (Lin, 2004) are not meaningful for this task and can be easily gamed. Our experiments find that even reliable human preference testing is challenging given the complexity of long form answers, which motivates us to look into the discourse structure of long form answers.

We take a linguistically informed approach with the dual purpose of (a) to better understand the structure of long form answers, and (b) to assist the evaluation of long-form QA systems. By characterizing the communicative functions of sentences in long form answers (which we call roles), e.g., signaling the organization of the answer, directly answering the question, giving an example, providing background information, etc., we analyze human-written, and machine-generated long form answers. Furthermore, our framework combines functional structures with the notion of information salience by designating a role for sentences that convey the main message of an answer.

We collect annotations on two datasets, ELI5 (Fan et al., 2019) and Natural Questions (NQ) (Kwiatkowski et al., 2019), which contains long form answers written by search users and from Wikipedia page respectively. In total, we provide fine-grained roles for 3.3K sentences (0.5K examples) and coarse annotation for 6K sentences (1.3K examples). We also annotate a small number (94) of machine-generated answers from a state-of-theart long form question answering system (Krishna et al., 2021) and provide rich analysis about their respective discourse structures. Our analysis demonstrates that studying answer structure can reveal a significant gap between machine-generated answers and human-written answers. We also present a competitive baseline model for automatic role classification, which performs on par with human agreement when trained with our annotated data. Lastly, our dataset yields a novel extractive summarization dataset, providing a benchmark for studying domain transfer in summarization and enabling QA models to provide concise answers to complex queries. We will release all our data and code at http://anonymous.co.

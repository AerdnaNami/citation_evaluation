Previous work in the image domain has analysed the output of specific layers in an attempt to identify adversarial examples or adversarial subspaces. First, (Feinman et al., 2017) proposed that adversarial subspaces have a lower probability density, motivating the use of the Kernel Density (KD) metric to detect the adversarial examples. Nevertheless, (Ma et al., 2018) found Local Intrinsic Dimensionality (LID) was a better metric in defining the subspace for more complex data. In contrast to the local subspace focused approaches of KD and LID, (Carrara et al., 2019b) showed that trajectories of hidden layer features can be used to train a LSTM network to accurately discriminate between authentic and adversarial examples. Out performing all previous methods, (  introduced an effective detection framework using Mahalanobis Distance Analysis (MDA), where the distance is calculated between a test sample and the closest class-conditional Gaussian distribution in the space defined by the output of the final layer of the classifier (logit space). (Li and Li, 2016) also explored using the output of convolutional layers for image classification systems to identify statistics that distinguish adversarial samples from original samples. They find that by performing a PCA decomposition the statistical variation in the least principal directions is the most significant and can be used to separate original and adversarial samples. However, they argue this is ineffective as an adversary can easily suppress the tail distribution. Hence, (Li and Li, 2016) extract statistics from the convolutional layer output to train a cascade classifier to separate the original and adversarial samples. Most recently, (Mao et al., 2019) avoid the use of artificially designed metrics and combine the adversarial subspace identification stage and the detecting adversaries stage into a single framework, where a parametric model adaptively learns the deep features for detecting adversaries.

In contrast to the embedding space detection approaches, (Cohen et al., 2019) shows that influence functions combined with Nearest Neighbour distances perform comparably or better than the above standard detection approaches. Other detection approaches have explored the use of uncertainty: (Smith and Gal, 2018) argues that adversarial examples are out of distribution and do not lie on the manifold of real data. Hence, a discriminative Bayesian model's epistemic (model) uncertainty should be high. Therefore, calculations of the model uncertainty are thought to be useful in detecting adversarial examples, independent of the domain. However, Bayesian approaches aren't always practical in implementation and thus many different approaches to approximate this uncertainty have been suggested in literature (Leibig et al., 2017;Gal, 2016;Gal and Ghahramani, 2016).

There are a number of existing NLP specific detection approaches. For character level attacks, detection approaches have exploited the grammatical (Sakaguchi et al., 2017) and spelling (Mays et al., 1991;Islam and Inkpen, 2009) inconsistencies to identify and detect the adversarial samples. However, these character level attacks are unlikely to be employed in practice due to the simplicity with which they can be detected. Therefore, detection approaches for the more difficult semantically similar attack samples are of greater interest, where the meaning of the textual input is maintained without compromising the spelling or gram-matical integrity. To tackle such word-level, semantically similar examples,  designed a discriminator to classify each token representation as part of an adversarial perturbation or not, which is then used to 'correct' the perturbation. Other detection approaches (Raina et al., 2020;Han et al., 2020;Minervini and Riedel, 2018) have shown some success in using perplexity to identify adversarial textual examples. Most recently, (Mozes et al., 2020) achieved state of the art performance with the Frequency Guided Word Substitution (FGWS) detector, where a change in model prediction after substituting out low frequency words is revealing of adversarial samples.

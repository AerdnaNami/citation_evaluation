Zero-shot cross-lingual structured prediction. Zero-shot cross-lingual learning becomes an emerging research topic as it eliminates the requirement of labeled data for training models in low-resource languages. Various structured prediction tasks have be studied, including named entity recognition (Pan et al., 2017;Hu et al., 2020), dependency parsing (Ahmad et al., 2019, relation extraction (Zou et al., 2018;Ni and Florian, 2019), and event argument extraction (Subburathinam et al., 2019;Ahmad et al., 2021;Nguyen and Nguyen, 2021). Most of them are classification-based models that build classifiers on top of a multilingual pre-trained masked language models. To further deal with the discrepancy between languages, some of them require additional information, such as bilingual dictionaries (Liu et al., 2019; Ni and Florian, 2019), translation pairs (Zou et al., 2018), and dependency parse trees (Subburathinam et al., 2019;Ahmad et al., 2021;Nguyen and Nguyen, 2021). However, as pointed out by previous literature (Li et al., 2021;Hsu et al., 2021), classification-based models are less powerful to model dependencies between entities compared to generation-based models.

Generation-based structured prediction. Several works have demonstrated the great success of generation-based models on monolingual structured prediction tasks, including named entity recognition (Yan et al., 2021), relation extraction (Huang et al., 2021;Paolini et al., 2021), and event extraction (Du et al., 2021;Hsu et al., 2021;Lu et al., 2021). Yet, as mentioned in Section 1, their designed generating targets are language-dependent. Accordingly, directly applying their methods to the zero-shot cross-lingual setting would result in less-preferred performance.

Prompting methods. There are growing interests recently to incorporate prompts on pre-trained language models in order to guide the models' behavior or elicit knowledge (Shin et al., 2020;Schick and Schütze, 2021;Qin and Eisner, 2021;Scao and Rush, 2021). Following the taxonomy in (Liu et al., 2021), these methods can be classified depending on whether the language models' parameters are tuned and on whether trainable prompts are introduced. Our method belongs to the category that fixes the prompts and tune the language models' parameters. Despite the flourish of the research in prompting methods, there is only limited attention being put on multilingual tasks (Winata et al., 2021).

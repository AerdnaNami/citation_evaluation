Pinyin Input Method 

We describe existing works based on whether the input pinyin is perfect or abbreviated. A majority of existing works focus on perfect pinyin. Traditional models are typically based on statistical language models (Chen and Lee, 2000) and statistical machine translation (Yang et al., 2012). Recent works are usually built with neural network. For example, Moon IME (Huang et al., 2018) integrates attention-based neural network and an information retrieval module. Zhang et al. (2019) improves an LSTM-
based encoder-decoder model with online vocabulary adaptation. For abbreviated pinyin, CoCAT (Huang et al., 2015) uses machine translation technology to reduce the number of the typing letters. Huang and Zhao (2018) propose an LSTM-based encoder-decoder approach with the concatenation of context words and abbreviated pinyin as input. Our work differs from existing works in that we are the first one to exploit GPT and verify the pros and cons of GPT in different situations. In addition, there are some works handling
pinyin with typing errors. Chen and Lee (2000) investigate a typing model which handles spelling correction in sentence-based pinyin input method. CHIME (Zheng et al., 2011) is a error-tolerant Chinese pinyin input method. It finds similar pinyin which will be further ranked with Chinese specific features. Jia and Zhao (2014) propose a joint graph model to globally optimize the tasks of pinyin input method and typo correction. We leave error-tolerant pinyin input method as a future work. 

Pinyin-enhanced Pretrained Models 

Our methodology also relates to pretrained models that use pinyin information. Sun et al. (2021) propose a general-purpose Chinese BERT with
new embedding layers to inject pinyin and glyph information of characters. There are also task-specific BERT models, especially for the task of grammatical error correction since an important type of error is caused by characters pronounced with the same pinyin. Zhang et al. (2021a) add a pinyin embedding layer and learns to predict characters from similarly pronounced candidates. PLOME (Liu et al., 2021) add two embedding layers implemented with two GRU networks to inject both pinyin and shape of characters, respectively. Xu et al. (2021) add a hierarchical encoder to inject the pinyin letters at character and sentence levels, and add a ResNet encoder to use graphic features of character image.

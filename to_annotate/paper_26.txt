Introduction

Figure 1 shows the increase in travel to the ACL annual meeting over the past 40 years. Whereas conferences used to be the privilege of a few academics, they are now attended by participants from companies, research institutes and universities across the world. This comes with an increase in the total volume of work published, and with it an increase in the carbon emissions attributed to travelling to in-person events.

In this study we seek to quantify the impact of conferences that are increasingly diverse in terms of participation and location (undoubtedly beneficial) on the increased carbon emissions (undoubtedly detrimental). We base our analysis on publications spanning 55 years , taken from the ACL Anthology. We use NLP tools to parse each document and identify the locations of the conference venues and lead researcher's institution. We answer the following questions:

1. Where is NLP research performed and presented?

2. What are the environmental costs?

3. Do conferences increase local participation?

4. Which events attract a diverse audience and how do they compare to non-physical venues?

To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to quantitatively explore the relationship between the location of conferences in a research field and diversity of participation. We make our dataset and code available to enable further discussion on the costs and benefits of in-person meetings.

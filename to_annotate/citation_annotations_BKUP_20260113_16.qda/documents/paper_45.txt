Hate speech in user-generated content has been an active research area recently (Fortuna and Nunes, 2018). Researchers have built several datasets for hate speech detection from diverse sources like Twitter (Waseem and Hovy, 2016;Davidson et al., 2017), Yahoo! (Nobata et al., 2016), Fox News (Gao and Huang, 2017), Gab (Mathew et al., 2021) and Reddit (Qian et al., 2019).

Compared to hate speech detection, few studies focus on detecting counter speech (Mathew et al., 2019;Ziems et al., 2020;Garland et al., 2020). Mathew et al. (2019) collect and handcode 6,898 counter hate comments from YouTube videos targeting Jews, Blacks and LGBT communities. Ziems et al. (2020) use a collection of hate and counter hate keywords relevant to COVID-19 and create a dataset containing 359 counter hate tweets targeting Asians. Garland et al. (2020) work with German tweets and define hate and counter speech based on the communities to which the authors belong. Another line of research focuses on curating datasets for counter speech generation using crowdsourcing (Qian et al., 2019) or with the help of trained operators (Chung et al., 2019;Fanton et al., 2021). However, synthetic language is rarely as rich as language in the wild. Even if it were, conclusions and models from synthetic data may not transfer to the real world. In this paper, we work with user-generated content expressing hate and counter-hate rather than synthetic content.

Table 2 summarizes existing datasets for Hate and Counter-hate detection. Most of them do not include context information. In other words, the preceding comments are not provided when annotating Targets. Context does affect human judgments and has been taken into account for Hate detection (Gao and Huang, 2017;Vidgen et al., 2021;Pavlopoulos et al., 2020;Menini et al., 2021). Gao and Huang (2017) annotate hateful comments in the nested structures of 10 Fox News discussion threads. Vidgen et al. (2021)  Utilizing conversational context has also been explored in text classification tasks such as sentiment analysis (Ren et al., 2016), stance (Zubiaga et al., 2018) and sarcasm (Ghosh et al., 2020). To our knowledge, we are the first to investigate the role of context in Hate and Counter-hate detection.

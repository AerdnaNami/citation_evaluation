Introduction

The dissemination of fake news has become an important social issue. For emergent complex events, human readers are usually exposed to multiple news documents, where some are real and others are fake. News documents from different sources naturally form a cluster of topically related documents. We notice that articles about the same topic may contain conflicting or complementary information, which can benefit the task of misinformation detection. An example is shown in Figure 1. As shown in the knowledge graph, the death of Rosanne Boyland in 2021 US Capitol attack is a shared event across all four documents. Each document is internally consistent, which makes it difficult to identify misinformation when judging each news separately. However, the three real news documents complement each other's statements regarding the death of Boyland, while the fake news document contradicts the other stories. Such crossdocument connections can be leveraged to help detect misinformation.

Most existing work in fake news detection is limited to judging each document in isolation. In contrast, we propose a novel task of cross-document misinformation detection that aims to detect fake information from a cluster of topically related news documents. We conduct the task at both document level and event level. Each event describes a specific type of real-world event mentioned in the text (e.g., the death of Boyland in Figure 1), and usually involves certain participants to represent different aspects of the event (e.g., the death cause and the victim of the death event). Document-level detection aims to detect fake news documents. Eventlevel detection is a more fine-grained task that aims to detect fake events, thereby pinpointing specific fake information in news documents.

Existing work on fine-grained misinformation detection detects fake knowledge triplets . However, we focus on identifying false events instead of relations or entities, because events are more important to storytelling, and easier to compare across multiple documents through cross-document coreference resolution.

To the best of our knowledge, there are no fake news detection datasets with clusters of topically related documents. Therefore, we construct 3 new benchmark datasets based on existing real news corpus with such clusters. Following Fung et al. (2021), we train a generator that generates a document from a knowledge graph (KG), and feed manipulated KGs into the generator to generate fake news documents. By tracking the manipulation operations, we also obtain supervision for event-level detection.

We further propose a detection system as shown in Figure 2. Given a cluster of documents, we first use an IE system (Lin et al., 2020) to construct a within-document KG for each document. Then, we connect the within-document KGs to form a crossdocument KG using cross-document event coreference resolution (Lai et al., 2021;Wen et al., 2021). Eventually, we use a heterogeneous graph neural network (GNN) to encode the cross-document KG and conduct detection at two levels.

Our contributions are summarized as follows:

1. We propose the novel task of cross-document misinformation detection, and conduct the task at two levels, document level and the more fine-grained event level. 
2. We construct 3 new datasets for our proposed task based on existing document clusters categorized by topics. 
3. We propose a detector that leverages crossdocument information and improve documentlevel detection by utilizing features produced by the event-level detector. Experiments on 3 datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing methods.

Introduction

Open-domain dialogue system often suffers from safe response (Li et al., 2015; problem as they could only refer to the context when generating a response. To alleviate this, Knowledge-grounded conversation (KGC) is proposed to introduce external fact and real-world commonsense as prior knowledge (Zhou et al., 2018a;Dinan et al., 2019;Zhao et al., 2020a), such that a dialogue system is able to ground the conversation with the provided knowledge and therefore generate informative and engaging responses. As external knowledge supplements the background to the inputs and decides what to say, knowledge selection is a key ingredient in KGC.

Numerous methods have been developed to tackle the knowledge selection problem by sequential latent variables (Kim et al., 2020;Meng et al., 2020), reinforcement learning (Zhao et al., 2020b), or expectation maximization algorithm (Li et al., 2020). In spite of the progress in this task, knowledge selection remains an unsolved problem as the precision is still far from satisfactory in Wizard of Wikipedia (Dinan et al., 2019) and other benchmarks in KGC (Gopalakrishnan et al., 2019), which also hinders the optimization of subsequent response generation models. A crucial point is, they often make assumption that the golden knowledge is distinguishable as long as the dialogue context is known, yet this is not always held true because there exists a one-to-many relationship in conversation and the past utterance history in a dialogue session is insufficient to decide the knowledge selection or the future trend of a dialogue.

As is shown in Figure 1, personalization is a key to success in the task because knowledge selection is a personal or subjective process in nature. When people communicate with each other, their perception of dialogue context will evoke their past memory about relevant life experience, taste and values, which we refer to as personal memory. The aroused fragment of personal memory further guides their interest and preference for different knowledge. In other words, there exists a mapping from one's personal memory to its selection of knowledge.

Importing persona memory into knowledge selection is a non-trivial task. One of the challenge is concretization of personal memory. Personal memory is an abstract concept related to user-specific experience, which is difficult to depict or model. Though it has been discussed in open-domain dialogue (Li et al., 2016;Zhang et al., 2018), no previous research sheds light on the personalization issue in KGC and there exists no dialogue dataset featured with external facts and personal memory at the same time. Besides, there is no annotated label to indicate which knowledge candidate a person will choose based on his or her personal memory. Namely, the mapping between personal memory and knowledge selection is highly unconstrained without golden label.

To address the above issue, we construct a KGC dataset featured with personalized memory repository, collecting user-specific utterance history under multiple types of context, which is a reflection of one's personal memory. And to discover the underlying relationship between the dialogue context, personal memory and knowledge, we propose a variational method and introduce two latent variables Z p and Z k to indicate the fragment of personal memory to evoke and the knowledge candidate to select respectively. And to model the mapping from Z p to Z k , we introduce an inverse mapping as a dual task and employ dual learning to allow the two mappings to teach each other. The motivation behind this is intuitive: The reconstruction of personal memory from selected knowledge candidate is natural and easy if the mapping from personal memory to knowledge is accurate. Extensive experiment shows that our methods outperform competitive baselines in both automatic evaluation and human evaluation, justifying the importance of introducing personal memory and the effect of the dual learning mechanism empirically.

The contributions of this work are three-fold:

(1) We explore the personalization issue of the knowledge selection task in KGC and construct a dataset featured with user-specific personal mem-ory to benefit relevant research in the future. We are the first to explore the possibility of introducing personal memory into KGC.

(2) We propose a novel variational method and introduce two latent variables to model the interdependency between the persona and knowledge. Besides, we employ dual learning to optimize the relationship between the dialogue context, personal memory and knowledge in a unified framework.

(3) We conduct extensive experiments and verify the proposed methods empirically. Both the automatic and human evaluation evidence the efficacy of our proposed method.

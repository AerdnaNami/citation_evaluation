      "full_text": "Related Work\n\nOver the last few years, the success of ToD systems is largely driven by the joint advent of neural network models (Eric et al., 2017;Wu et al., 2019; and collections of largescale annotation corpora. These corpora cover a wide range of topics from a single domain (e.g., ATIS (Hemphill et al., 1990), DSTC 2 (Henderson et al., 2014), Frames (El Asri et al., 2017, KVRET (Eric et al., 2017), WoZ 2.0 (Wen et al., 2017), M2M (Schatzmann et al., 2007)) to multiple domains (e.g., MultiWoZ (Budzianowski et al., 2018), SGD ). Most notably among these collections, MultiWoZ is a large-scale multidomain dataset that focuses on transitions between different domains or scenarios in real conversations (Budzianowski et al., 2018). Due to the high cost of collecting task-oriented dialogues, only a few monolingual or bilingual non-English ToD datasets are available Quan et al., 2020;Lin et al., 2021). While there is an increasing interest in data curation for multilingual ToD systems, a vast majority of existing multilingual ToD datasets do not consider the real use cases when using a ToD system to search for local entities in a country. We fill this gap in this paper to provide the first analysis on three previously unexplored use cases.\n\n "

This includes techniques that predict the veracity of a claim based on the text of the claim only (Rashkin et al., 2017), linguistic features (Popat et al., 2017), meta information about the claimant (e.g., name, job, party affiliation, veracity history) (Wang, 2017b), review articles (Augenstein et al., 2019;Shu et al., 2018;Nakov et al., 2021), as well as relevant articles returned by a search engine (Popat et al., 2018;Augenstein et al., 2019;Mishra and Setty, 2019). To the best of our knowledge, none of the existing work considers the problem of claim verification based on premise articles. There is an important distinction between articles returned by a search engine in previous work and the premise articles that we consider. The techniques that use a search engine to find articles related to a claim query the search engine after a fact checking website has published a review article and therefore end up retrieving articles that include the review article as well as other articles that summarize and/or discuss the verdict of the fact checking website. Hence they are tackling an entailment problem. In contrast, the premise articles that we consider are the source articles used by a fact checker before publishing a review article. Those articles contain relevant facts, but not a summary or discussion of the review article since they are published before the review article and in fact serve as premises for the review article.\n\nClosely related to claim verification is the problem of fake news detection.

      "full_text": "Introduction\n\nNamed entity recognition (NER) aims at identifying text spans pertaining to specific entity types. It plays an important role in many downstream tasks such as relation extraction (Ji et al., 2017), entity linking (Sevgili et al., 2020), co-reference resolution (Clark and Manning, 2016), and knowledge graph (Ji et al., 2020). Due to the complex composition (Gui et al., 2019), character-level Chinese NER is more challenging compared to English NER. As shown in Figure 1 (a), the middle charac-  ter \"流\" can constitute words with the characters to both their left and their right, such as \"河流 (River)\" and \"流经 (flows)\", leading to ambiguous character boundaries.\n\nThere are two typical frameworks for NER. The first one conceptualizes NER as a sequence labeling task (Huang et al., 2015;Lample et al., 2016;Ma and Hovy, 2016), where each character is assigned to a special label (e.g., B-LOC, I-LOC). The second one is span-based method (Li et al., 2020a;, which classifies candidate spans based on their span-level representations. However, despite the success of these two types of methods, they do not explicitly take the complex composition of Chinese NER into consideration. Recently, several works (Zhang and Yang, 2018;Gui et al., 2019;Li et al., 2020b) utilize external lexicon knowledge to help connect related characters and promote capturing the local composition. Nevertheless, building the lexicon is time-consuming and the quality of the lexicon may not be satisfied.\n\nIn contrast to previous works, we observe that the regularity exists in the common NER types (e.g., ORG and LOC). As shown in Figure 1 (a), \"尼日尔河 (Niger River)\" follows the specific composition pattern \"XX+河 (XX + River)\" which ends with indicator character \"河\" and mostly belongs to location type, and the ambiguous character \"流\" can properly constitute \"流经\" with the right character \"经\". Thus, the regularity information serves as important clues for entity type recognition and identifying the character composition. Formally, we refer to regularity as specific internal patterns contained in a type of entity (Lin et al., 2020). However, too immersed regularity leads to unfavorable boundary detection of entities and disturbing character composition. As shown in Figure 1 (b), \"中国队 (Chinese team)\" conforms to the pattern \"XX+队 (XX + Team)\", but the correct entity boundary should be \"中国 (Chinese)\" and \"队员 (players)\" according to the context. Therefore, the context also plays a key role in determining the character boundary.\n\nIn this paper, we introduce a simple but effective method to explore the regularity information of entity spans for Chinese NER, dubbed as Regularity-Inspired reCOgnition Network (RICON). The proposed model consists of two branches named regularity-aware module and regularity-agnostic module, where each module has task-specific encoder and optimization object. Concretely, the regularity-aware module aims at analyzing the internal regularity of each span and integrates the significant regularity information into the corresponding span-level representation, leading to precise entity type prediction. Meanwhile, the regularityagnostic module is devised to capture context information and avoid excessive focus on intra-span regularity. Furthermore, we adopt an orthogonality space restriction to encourage two branches to extract different features with regard to the regularity.

      "full_text": "Introduction\n\nOpen-domain dialogue system often suffers from safe response (Li et al., 2015; problem as they could only refer to the context when generating a response. To alleviate this, Knowledge-grounded conversation (KGC) is proposed to introduce external fact and real-world commonsense as prior knowledge (Zhou et al., 2018a;Dinan et al., 2019;Zhao et al., 2020a), such that a dialogue system is able to ground the conversation with the provided knowledge and therefore generate informative and engaging responses. As external knowledge supplements the background to the inputs and decides what to say, knowledge selection is a key ingredient in KGC.\n\nNumerous methods have been developed to tackle the knowledge selection problem by sequential latent variables (Kim et al., 2020;Meng et al., 2020), reinforcement learning (Zhao et al., 2020b), or expectation maximization algorithm (Li et al., 2020). In spite of the progress in this task, knowledge selection remains an unsolved problem as the precision is still far from satisfactory in Wizard of Wikipedia (Dinan et al., 2019) and other benchmarks in KGC (Gopalakrishnan et al., 2019), which also hinders the optimization of subsequent response generation models. A crucial point is, they often make assumption that the golden knowledge is distinguishable as long as the dialogue context is known, yet this is not always held true because there exists a one-to-many relationship in conversation and the past utterance history in a dialogue session is insufficient to decide the knowledge selection or the future trend of a dialogue.\n\nAs is shown in Figure 1, personalization is a key to success in the task because knowledge selection is a personal or subjective process in nature. When people communicate with each other, their perception of dialogue context will evoke their past memory about relevant life experience, taste and values, which we refer to as personal memory. The aroused fragment of personal memory further guides their interest and preference for different knowledge. In other words, there exists a mapping from one's personal memory to its selection of knowledge.\n\nImporting persona memory into knowledge selection is a non-trivial task. One of the challenge is concretization of personal memory. Personal memory is an abstract concept related to user-specific experience, which is difficult to depict or model. Though it has been discussed in open-domain dialogue (Li et al., 2016;Zhang et al., 2018), no previous research sheds light on the personalization issue in KGC and there exists no dialogue dataset featured with external facts and personal memory at the same time. Besides, there is no annotated label to indicate which knowledge candidate a person will choose based on his or her personal memory. Namely, the mapping between personal memory and knowledge selection is highly unconstrained without golden label.\n\nTo address the above issue, we construct a KGC dataset featured with personalized memory repository, collecting user-specific utterance history under multiple types of context, which is a reflection of one's personal memory. And to discover the underlying relationship between the dialogue context, personal memory and knowledge, we propose a variational method and introduce two latent variables Z p and Z k to indicate the fragment of personal memory to evoke and the knowledge candidate to select respectively. And to model the mapping from Z p to Z k , we introduce an inverse mapping as a dual task and employ dual learning to allow the two mappings to teach each other. The motivation behind this is intuitive: The reconstruction of personal memory from selected knowledge candidate is natural and easy if the mapping from personal memory to knowledge is accurate. Extensive experiment shows that our methods outperform competitive baselines in both automatic evaluation and human evaluation, justifying the importance of introducing personal memory and the effect of the dual learning mechanism empirically.\n\nThe contributions of this work are three-fold:\n\n(1) We explore the personalization issue of the knowledge selection task in KGC and construct a dataset featured with user-specific personal mem-ory to benefit relevant research in the future. We are the first to explore the possibility of introducing personal memory into KGC.\n\n(2) We propose a novel variational method and introduce two latent variables to model the interdependency between the persona and knowledge. Besides, we employ dual learning to optimize the relationship between the dialogue context, personal memory and knowledge in a unified framework.\n\n(3) We conduct extensive experiments and verify the proposed methods empirically. Both the automatic and human evaluation evidence the efficacy of our proposed method.\n\n "

      "full_text": "Related Work\n\nVision-and-language navigation. Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) requires an agent to find the routes to the desired target based on instructions Thomason et al., 2020;Nguyen and Daumé III, 2019;Chen et al., 2019;Krantz et al., 2020). Specifically, there are two key challenges in VLN: grounding the natural language instruction to visual environments and generalizing to unseen environments. To address the first challenge, one line of research in VLN utilizes carefully designed cross-modal attention modules (Wang et al., , 2019aTan et al., 2019;Landi et al., 2019;Xia et al., 2020;Wang et al., 2020b,a;Zhu et al., 2020;Zhu et al., 2021;, progress monitor modules (Ma et al., 2019b,a;Ke et al., 2019), and object-action aware modules (Qi et al., 2020a). Another line of research improves vision and language co-grounding by improving vision and language representations with pre-training techniques (Li et al., 2019;Huang et al., 2019b;Hong et al., 2021). Li et al. (2019) directly adopts pre-trained BERT for encoding instructions,  and Hong et al. (2021) learn from a large amount of image-textaction triplets,  learns from large amount of text-image pairs from the web, and Huang et al. (2019b) transfers language and visual representation to in-domain representation with auxiliary tasks. Different from them, we utilize the visually-aligned multilingual instructions to learn a cross-lingual language representation that inherently captures visual semantics underlying the instruction.\n\nMultiple methods have been proposed to encourage generalization to unseen environments during training (Zhang et al., 2020;Tan et al., 2019;Wang et al., 2020c;Fu et al., 2020). Zhang et al. (2020) demonstrates that it is the low-level appearance information that causes the large performance gap between seen and unseen environments. Tan et al. (2019) proposes to use environment dropout on visual features to create new environments and Fu et al. (2020) utilizes adversarial path sampling to encourage generalization. However, both of these methods rely on a speaker module to generate synthetic training data and can be considered as data augmentation methods, which are complementary to our proposed environment-agnostic visual representation. The closest work to ours is Wang et al. (2020c), where they proposes to pair an environment classifier with gradient reversal layer to learn an environment-agnostic representation. However, they only consider one single environment when learning the visual representation for a given path (i.e., given one path and predict its environment). In our environment-agnostic representation learning, we explore the connections between multiple environments (i.e., maximize the similarity between paths from different environments). Vision-and-language with multilinguality. There has been growing interest in combining vision and language for tasks such as visual-guided machine translation (Sigurdsson et al., 2020;Surís et al., 2020;Huang et al., 2020), multi-lingual visual question answering (Gao et al., 2015;Gupta et al., 2020;Shimizu et al., 2018), multi-lingual image captioning (Gu et al., 2018;Lan et al., 2017), multilingual video captioning (Wang et al., 2019b), and multi-lingual image-sentence retrieval Burns et al., 2020). In this paper, we work on multi-lingual vision-and-language navigation. We use vision (i.e., navigation path) as a bridge between multi-lingual instructions and learn a crosslingual representation that captures visual concepts. Furthermore, our approach also use language as a bridge between different visual environments to learn an environment-agnostic visual representation.\n\n "

Pluralist moral philosophers argue that human morality can be represented, understood, and explained by a finite number of irreducible basic elements, referred to as moral values (Graham et al., 2013). The difference in our preferences over moral values explains how and why we think differently. For instance, both conservatives and liberals may agree that individual welfare is important. However, a conservative, who cherishes the values of freedom and independence, may believe that taxes should be decreased to attain more individual welfare. In contrast, a liberal, who cherishes the values of community and care, may believe that taxes should be increased to obtain welfare (Graham et al., 2009).\n\nIt is crucial to understand human morality to develop beneficial AI (Soares and Fallenstein, 2017;Russell, 2019). As artificial agents live and operate among humans (Akata et al., 2020), they must be able to comprehend and recognize the moral values that drive the differences in human behavior (Gabriel, 2020). The ability to understand moral rhetoric can be instrumental for, e.g., facilitating human-agent trust (Chhogyal et al., 2019;Mehrotra et al., 2021) and engineering value-aligned sociotechnical systems (Murukannaiah et al., 2020;Serramia et al., 2020;Montes and Sierra, 2021).\n\nThere are survey instruments to estimate individual value profiles (Schwartz, 2012;Graham et al., 2013). However, reasoning about moral values is challenging for humans (Le Dantec et al., 2009;Pommeranz et al., 2012). Further, in practical applications, e.g., to conduct meaningful conversations (Tigunova et al., 2019) or to identify online trends (Mooijman et al., 2018), artificial agents should be able to understand moral rhetoric on the fly.\n\nThe growing capabilities of natural language processing (NLP) enable the estimation of moral rhetoric from discourse Mooijman et al., 2018;Rezapour et al., 2019;Hoover et al., 2020;Araque et al., 2020). Value classifiers can be used to identify the moral values underlying a piece of text on the fly. For instance, Mooijman et al. (2018) show that detecting moral values from tweets can predict violent protests.\n\nExisting value classifiers are evaluated on a specific dataset, without re-training or testing the classifier on a different dataset. This shows the ability of the classifier to predict values from text, but not the ability to transfer the learned knowledge across datasets. A critical aspect of moral values is that they are intrinsically linked to the domain under discussion (Pommeranz et al., 2012;Liscio et al., 2021). Moral value expressions may take different forms in different domains. For example, in the driving domain, the value of safety concerns speed limits and seat belts, but in the COVID-19 domain, safety concerns social distancing and face masks. Thus, a word (broadly, language) may trigger different moral rhetoric in different domains. For example, in a libertarian blog, the word 'taxes' may be linked to the authority values, but in a socialist blog it may be linked to the community values. Then, it is crucial for a value classifier to recognize domain-specific connotations of moral rhetoric.\n\nCollecting and annotating a sufficient amount of training examples in each domain is expensive and time consuming. To reduce the need for new annotated examples, we can pretrain classifiers with similar available annotated data and transfer the acquired knowledge to a novel task-a practice known as transfer learning (Ruder, 2019). Despite the benefits, transfer learning poses wellknown challenges, including: (1) generalizability: how well does a classifier perform on novel data? (2) transferability: how well is knowledge transferred from one domain to another? and (3) catastrophic forgetting: to what extent is knowledge of a previous domain lost after training in a new domain? These challenges are crucial for value classification because of its domain-specific nature.\n\nWe perform the first comprehensive crossdomain evaluation of a value classifier. We employ the Moral Foundation Twitter Corpus (Hoover et al., 2020), consisting of seven datasets spanning different socio-political areas, annotated with the value taxonomy of the Moral Foundation Theory (Graham et al., 2013). Treating each dataset as a domain, we train a deep learning model (BERT Devlin et al. (2019)) in four training settings to evaluate the value classifier's generalizability, transferability, and catastrophic forgetting.\n\nOur experiments show that (1) a value classifier can generalize to novel domains, especially when trained on a varied array of domains, (2) initializing a classifier with examples from different domains improves performance in novel domains even when little training data is available in the novel domains, (3) catastrophic forgetting occurs even when training on a small portion of data from the novel domain, and its impact must be considered when training on a novel domain, and (4) in the large majority of cases, in all considered training settings, there is at least one annotator that agrees with the model predictions. These results provide insights to researchers and practitioners on estimating moral values in different domains.\n\n "

      "full_text": "Introduction\n\nDistributed representations of events, are a common way to represent events in a machine-readable form and have shown to provide meaningful features for various tasks (Lee and Goldwasser, 2018;Rezaee and Ferraro, 2021;Deng et al., 2021;Martin et al., 2018;. Obtaining effective event representations is challenging, as it requires representations to capture various relations between events. Figure 1 presents four pairs of events with different relations. Two events may share the same event attributes (e.g. event types and sentiments), and there may also be a causal or temporal relation between two events.\n\nEarly works (Weber et al., 2018) exploit easily accessible co-occurrence relation of events to learn event representations. Although the use of cooccurrence relation works well, it is too coarse for deep understanding of events, which requires finegrained knowledge (Lee and Goldwasser, 2019). Recent works focus on fine-grained knowledge, such as discourse relations (Prasad et al., 2006;Lee and Goldwasser, 2019;Zheng et al., 2020) and commonsense knowledge (e.g. sentiments and intents) (Sap et al., 2019;Ding et al., 2019). Concretely, Lee and Goldwasser (2019) and Zheng et al. (2020) leverage 11 discourse relation types to model event script knowledge. Ding et al. (2019) incorporate manually labeled commonsense knowledge (intents and sentiments) into event representation learning. However, the types of fine-grained event knowledge are so diverse that we cannot enumerate all of them and currently adopted finegrained knowledge fall under a small set of event knowledge. In addition, some manually labeled knowledge (Sap et al., 2019;Hwang et al., 2021) is costly and difficult to apply on large datasets.\n\nIn our work, we observe that there is a rich amount of information in co-occurring events, but previous works did not make good use of such information. Based on existing works on event relation extraction (Xue et al., 2016;Lee and Goldwasser, 2019;, we find that the co-occurrence relation, which refers to two events appearing in the same document, can be seen as a superset of current defined explicit discourse relations, as most existing automatic methods extract event relations from documents or sentences. More than that, it also includes other implicit event knowledge, that is, events that occur in the same document may share the same topic and event type. Previous works (Granroth-Wilding and Clark, 2016;Weber et al., 2018) based on cooccurrence information usually exploit instancewise contrastive learning approaches related to the margin loss, which consists of an anchor, positive, and negative sample, where the anchor is more similar to the positive than the negative. However, they share two common limitations: (1) such marginbased approaches struggle to capture the essential differences between events with different semantics, as they only consider one positive and one negative per anchor. (2) Randomly sampled negative samples may contain samples semantically related to the anchor but are undesirably pushed apart in embedding space. This problem arises because these instance-wise contrastive learning approaches treat randomly selected events as negative samples, regardless of their semantic relevance.\n\nWe are motivated to address the above issues with the goal of making better use of cooccurrence information of events. To this end, we present SWCC: a Simultaneous Weakly supervised Contrastive learning and Clustering framework for event representation learning, where we exploit document-level co-occurrence information of events as weak supervision and learn event representations by simultaneously performing weakly supervised contrastive learning and prototype-based clustering. To address the first issue, we build our approach on the contrastive framework with the InfoNCE objective (van den Oord et al., 2019), which is a self-supervised contrastive learning method that uses one positive and multiple negatives. Further, we extend the InfoNCE to a weakly supervised contrastive learning setting, allowing us to consider multiple positives and multiple negatives per anchor (as opposed to the margin loss which uses only one positive and one negative). Co-occurring events are then incorporated as additional positives, weighted by a normalized co-occurrence frequency. To address the second issue, we introduce a prototype-based clustering method to avoid semantically related events being pulled apart. Specifically, we impose a prototype for each cluster, which is a representative embed-ding for a group of semantically related events. Then we cluster the data while enforce consistency between cluster assignments produced for different augmented representations of an event. Unlike the instance-wise contrastive learning, our clustering method focuses on the cluster-level semantic concepts by contrasting between representations of events and clusters. Overall, we make the following contributions:\n\n• We propose a simple and effective framework (SWCC) that learns event representations by making better use of co-occurrence information of events. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms previous approaches on several event related tasks. • We introduce a weakly supervised contrastive learning method that allows us to consider multiple positives and multiple negatives, and a prototype-based clustering method that avoids semantically related events being pulled apart. • We provide a thorough analysis of the prototypebased clustering method to demonstrate that the learned prototype vectors are able to implicitly capture various relations between events. The source code 1 of our SWCC has been uploaded to Anonymous Github for reproducing our results.\n\n "

      "full_text": "Introduction\n\nGiven some text (typically, a sentence) t mentioning an entity pair (e 1 , e 2 ), the goal of relation extraction (RE) is to predict the relationships between e 1 and e 2 that can be inferred from t. Let B(e 1 , e 2 ) denote the set of all sentences (bag) in the corpus mentioning e 1 and e 2 and let R(e 1 , e 2 ) denote all relations from e 1 to e 2 in a KB. Distant supervision (DS) trains RE models given B(e 1 , e 2 ) and R(e 1 , e 2 ), without sentence level annotation (Mintz et al., 2009). Most DS-RE models use the \"at-least one\" assumption: ∀r ∈ R(e 1 , e 2 ), ∃t r ∈ B(e 1 , e 2 ) such that t r expresses (e 1 , r, e 2 ).\n\nRecent neural approaches to DS-RE encode each sentence t ∈ B(e 1 , e 2 ) and then aggregate sentence embeddings using an aggregation operator -the common operator being intra-bag attention (Lin et al., 2016). Various models differ in their approach to encoding (e.g., PCNNs, GCNs, BERT) and their loss functions (e.g., contrastive learning, MLM), but agree on the design choice of encoding each sentence independently of the others (Vashishth et al., 2018;Alt et al., 2019;Christou and Tsoumakas, 2021;Chen et al., 2021). We posit that this choice leads to a suboptimal usage of the available data -information from other sentences might help in better encoding a given sentence.\n\nWe explore this hypothesis by developing a simple baseline solution. We first construct a passage P (e 1 , e 2 ) by concatenating all sentences in B(e 1 , e 2 ). We then encode the whole passage through BERT (Devlin et al., 2019) (or mBERT for multilingual setting). This produces a contextualized embedding of every token in the bag. To make these embeddings aware of the candidate relation, we take a (trained) relation query vector, r, to generate a relation-aware summary of the whole passage using attention. This is then used to predict whether (e 1 , r, e 2 ) is a valid prediction.\n\nDespite its simplicity, our baseline has some conceptual advantages. First, each token is able to exchange information with other tokens from other sentences in the bag -so the embeddings are likely more informed. Second, in principle, the model may be able to relax a part of the at-least-one assumption. For example, if no sentence individually expresses a relation, but if multiple facts in different sentences collectively predict the relation, our model may be able to learn to extract that.\n\nWe name our baseline model Passage-Attended Relation Extraction, PARE (mPARE for multilingual DS-RE). We experiment on four DS-RE datasets -three in English, NYT-10d (Riedel et al., 2010), NYT-10m, and Wiki-20m (Gao et al., 2021), and one multilingual, DiS-ReX (Bhartiya et al., 2021). We find that in all four datasets, our proposed baseline significantly outperforms existing state of the art, yielding up to 5 point AUC gain. Further attention analysis and ablations provide additional insight into model performance. We release our code for reproducibility. We believe that our work represents a simple but strong baseline that can form the basis for further DS-RE research.\n\n "

Following the taxonomy in (Liu et al., 2021), these methods can be classified depending on whether the language models' parameters are tuned and on whether trainable prompts are introduced. Our method belongs to the category that fixes the prompts and tune the language models' parameters. Despite the flourish of the research in prompting methods, there is only limited attention being put on multilingual tasks (Winata et al., 2021).\n\n "

      "full_text": "Related work\n\nUncertainty estimation in deep learning is a topic that has been studied extensively. Bayesian deep learning includes a family of methods that attempt to capture the notion of uncertainty in deep neural networks. Such methods have gained increased popularity in the deep learning literature and there exist multiple applications in subfields such as Computer Vision (Kendall and Gal, 2017;Litjens et al., 2017; and Natural Language Processing (NLP) (Siddhant and Lipton, 2020;Lyu et al., 2020;.\n\nDespite their obvious advantage of modeling uncertainty, the main problem with Bayesian deep learning methods is the computational cost of full Bayesian inference. To tackle this problem, Gal and Ghahramani (2016) propose using standard dropout (Srivastava et al., 2014) as a practical approximation of Bayesian inference in deep neural networks and call this method Monte Carlo dropout.  use a convolutional neural network with Monte Carlo dropout in order to obtain an uncertainty estimate for active learning in the task of image classification. Houlsby et al. (2011) sample many networks with Monte Carlo simulation and propose an objective function that takes into account the disagreement and confidence of the predictions coming from these networks.\n\nSimilar methods have also been applied to NLP. In machine translation,  extend the Transformer architecture with MC dropout to get a Variational Transformer, and use it to sample multiple translations from the approximate posterior distribution. They also introduce BLEUVar, an uncertainty metric based on the BLEU score (Papineni et al., 2002) between pairs of the generated translations. Lyu et al. (2020) extend the work of  to question answering and propose an active learning approach based on a modified BLEUVar version.

      "full_text": "Introduction\n\nKnowledge-grounded conversational models, powered by large pre-trained language models (Radford et al., 2019;Brown et al., 2020;Raffel et al., 2020), are well-known to generate factually incorrect statements, a phenomenon commonly called hallucination (Dziri et al., 2021b;Rashkin et al., 2021b). A large commonality in the majority of prior work seeks to address hallucination by ameliorating the model (Shuster et al., 2021;Mielke et al., 2020;Dziri et al., 2021a;Rashkin et al., 2021b), but no attempt has been made so far to audit the conversational benchmarks to the best of our knowledge.\n\nOn one hand, knowledge-grounded conversational benchmarks may contain hallucinations due to error-prone collection protocols, or due to a design framework that encourages informativeness over faithfulness. Existing dialogue systems are typically trained on corpora crowd-sourced through online platforms (Dinan et al., 2018; Gopalakrishnan et al., 2019; Moon et al., 2019). With loose incentive to come up with faithfully-grounded utterances on the provided knowledge, crowdworkers may ignore knowledge-snippets altogether, use their personal knowledge or sometimes assume a fictional persona, resulting in conversations that are rife with subjective content and unverified factual knowledge. Figure 1 shows a hallucinated conversation from the WoW dataset (Dinan et al., 2018), On the other hand, neural conversational models are not necessarily designed to generate faithful outputs, but to mimic the distributional properties of the data. This kind of optimization will likely push the models to replicate and even amplify the hallucination behaviour at test time (Bender et al., 2021). The presence of even few hallucinated responses may skew the data distribution in a way that curbs the model's ability to generate faithful responses (Kang and Hashimoto, 2020).\n\nIn this work, drawing insights from the linguistic coding system for discourse phenomena (Stiles, 1992) and evaluation frameworks such as BEGIN (Dziri et al., 2021b) and AIS (Rashkin et al., 2021a), we annotate responses from the three widely-used knowledge-grounded conversational benchmarks: Wizard of Wikipedia (Dinan et al., 2018), CMU-DoG (Zhou et al., 2018) and Topi-calChat (Gopalakrishnan et al., 2019). Our analysis reveals surprisingly that more than 60% of the responses are hallucinated in the three datasets, with major hallucination modes that manifest principally through the expression of subjective information (e.g., thoughts, beliefs, feelings, intentions, personal experiences) and the expression of unsupported objective factual information. Further, to understand if neural conversational models make this hallucination more severe, we annotate responses generated by several state-of-the-art models, including ones that are designed to alleviate hallucinations. We find that the generated responses consist of an even larger portion of hallucinations, in comparison with the training data. Our findings question the quality of current conversational datasets, their appropriateness to train knowledgegrounded conversational systems, and the robustness of existing models.\n\n "

A majority of existing works focus on perfect pinyin. Traditional models are typically based on statistical language models (Chen and Lee, 2000) and statistical machine translation (Yang et al., 2012). Recent works are usually built with neural network. For example, Moon IME (Huang et al., 2018) integrates attention-based neural network and an information retrieval module. Zhang et al.

For abbreviated pinyin, CoCAT (Huang et al., 2015) uses machine translation technology to reduce the number of the typing letters. Huang and Zhao (2018) propose an LSTM-based encoder-decoder approach with the concatenation of context words and abbreviated pinyin as input. Our work differs from existing works in that we are the first one to exploit GPT and verify the pros and cons of GPT in different situations. In addition, there are some works handling\npinyin with typing errors. Chen and Lee (2000) investigate a typing model which handles spelling correction in sentence-based pinyin input method. CHIME (Zheng et al., 2011) is a error-tolerant Chinese pinyin input method. It finds similar pinyin which will be further ranked with Chinese specific features. Jia and Zhao (2014) propose a joint graph model to globally optimize the tasks of pinyin input method and typo correction. We leave error-tolerant pinyin input method as a future work. \n\nPinyin-enhanced Pretrained Models \n\nOur methodology also relates to pretrained models that use pinyin information. Sun et al. (2021) propose a general-purpose Chinese BERT with\nnew embedding layers to inject pinyin and glyph information of characters. There are also task-specific BERT models, especially for the task of grammatical error correction since an important type of error is caused by characters pronounced with the same pinyin. Zhang et al. (2021a) add a pinyin embedding layer and learns to predict characters from similarly pronounced candidates. PLOME (Liu et al., 2021) add two embedding layers implemented with two GRU networks to inject both pinyin and shape of characters, respectively. Xu et al. (2021) add a hierarchical encoder to inject the pinyin letters at character and sentence levels, and add a ResNet encoder to use graphic features of character image.\n\n "

      "full_text": "Introduction\n\nReading comprehension is a complex, multidimensional cognitive process (Kim, 2017). Question answering (QA) are fundamental for supporting humans’ development of reading comprehension skills, as questions serve as both instruments for evaluation and tools to facilitate learning. To achieve this goal, comprehension questions should be valid and reliable, meaning that all items are designed to cohesively assess comprehension rather than some other skills (e.g., text matching, paraphrasing, or memorization) (Roberts and Priest, 2006). Moreover, from the educational perspective, given that reading comprehension is a multicomponent skill, it is ideal for comprehension questions to be able to identify students’ performance in specific sub-skills, thus allowing teachers to provide tailored guidance (Francis et al., 2005). This kind of high-quality questions is also valuable for improving machine reading comprehension.\n\nHowever, creating a large and suitable set of questions for supporting narrative comprehension is both time-consuming and cognitively demanding. Some researchers have proposed to develop models to automatically generate questions to satisfy the need for a continuous supply of new questions (Kurdi et al., 2020). However, existing datasets are not particularly suitable for training question generation (QG) models for educational purposes (Das et al., 2021). This is primarily because the datasets are not typically structured around the specific dimensions of reading comprehension sub-skills, nor do they provide sufficient information on what sub-skills are tested. As a consequence, QG  models built on these datasets only yield one single \"comprehension\" score without a more detailed breakdown of performance on comprehension sub-skills. This issue is compounded by the fact that many benchmarks rely on crowd-sourced workers who may not have sufficient training or education domain knowledge needed to create valid questions in a onsistent way. To bridge the gap, we constructed FairytaleQA, an open-source dataset focusing on comprehension of narratives, targeting students from kindergarten to eighth grade (Table 1). We focus on narrative comprehension for two reasons. First, narrative comprehension is a high-level comprehension skill strongly predictive of reading achievement (Lynch et al., 2008) and plays a central role in daily life as people frequently encounter narratives in different forms (Goldie, 2003). Second, narrative stories have a clear structure of specific elements and relations among these elements, and there are existing validated narrative comprehension frameworks around this structure, which provides a basis for developing the annotation schema for our dataset. We employed education experts who generated 10,580 question-answer pairs based on a collection of 278 fairytale stories for young readers, following evidence-based narrative comprehension frameworks (Paris and Paris, 2003; Alonzo et al., 2009). Thereby, FairytaleQA contains questions that focus on seven narrative elements and relations, namely character, setting, feeling, action, causal relationship, outcome resolution, and prediction (Paris and Paris, 2003), thus increasing the validity and reliability of the assessment. In addition, FairytaleQA also contains both explicit questions that involve answers found directly in the text and implicit questions that require inference making and high-level summarization, thus representing a relatively balanced assessment with questions of varying difficulty levels. Most importantly, our selection of annotators with education domain knoweldge as well as the training and quality control process ensured that the aforementioned annotation protocol was consistently implemented. A subset of questions in our dataset has been validated with 120 kindergarten students, proving the questions’ reliability and validity.\nWe show the utility of FairytaleQA through two benchmarking experiments. First, we used our data to train and evaluate state-of-the-art QA models and demonstrated that (1) FairytaleQA contains challenging phenonmena for existing models, and (2) it can support finer-grained analysis on the aforementioned seven types of comprehension sub-skills,\neven for models trained on standard QA datasets (NarrativeQA (Koˇcisk `y et al., 2018)). We further calibrated model performances with human baseline, highlighting the most visible gap on models’ reasoning capabilities on recognizing casual relationships and predicting event outcomes. Second, we used FairytaleQA to power question generation and showed that the QG model trained on ours was more capable of asking diverse questions and generating questions with higher quality.\n\n "

A subset of questions in our dataset has been validated with 120 kindergarten students, proving the questions’ reliability and validity.\nWe show the utility of FairytaleQA through two benchmarking experiments. First, we used our data to train and evaluate state-of-the-art QA models and demonstrated that (1) FairytaleQA contains challenging phenonmena for existing models, and (2) it can support finer-grained analysis on the aforementioned seven types of comprehension sub-skills,\neven for models trained on standard QA datasets (NarrativeQA (Koˇcisk `y et al., 2018)). We further calibrated model performances with human baseline, highlighting the most visible gap on models’ reasoning capabilities on recognizing casual relationships and predicting event outcomes. Second, we used FairytaleQA to power question generation and showed that the QG model trained on ours was more capable of asking diverse questions and generating questions with higher quality.\n\n "

      "full_text": "Related Work\n\nTask-Oriented Dialogue. Task-oriented dialogue aims at accomplishing user's goal. Traditional systems (Williams and Young, 2007;Young et al., 2013) adopt a pipelined approach that requires dialogue state tracking for understanding user's goal, dialogue policy learning for deciding which system action to take, and natural language generation for generating dialogue responses.\n\nRecently, to simplify the modelling effort, researchers have shifted their attention to building neural network models that address the TOD subtasks Eric et al., 2017;Lei et al., 2018;Liang et al., 2020). With the advances in pretrained language models (PLMs), Budzianowski and Vulić (2019) first applied the GPT-2 model for the NLG task. Lin et al. (2020) and  moved one step forward and utilized pretrained language models to solve all TOD sub-tasks conditioned on the history of oracle belief states. Based on the GPT-2 model, Hosseini-Asl et al. (2020) proposed a cascaded model, SimpleTOD, that addresses all TOD sub-tasks without using the oracle information. To improve the system performance, Peng et al. (2021) and Liu et al. (2021) applied dialogue pre-training over external dialogue corpora. However, both methods require the pretraining data to be fully annotated for all TOD sub-tasks (i.e., DST, POL, and NLG) which greatly limits the amount of data they can use. Additionally, Liu et al. (2021) achieved better results with noisy chanel model that requires two additional language models for outputs re-scoring. Unlike their approach, we address the task of task-oriented dialogue with a single unified model.\n\nLanguage Model Pre-training. The research community has witnessed remarkable progress of pre-training methods in a wide range of NLP tasks, including language understanding (Peters et al., 2018;Devlin et al., 2019;Yang et al., 2019) and text generation (Radford et al., 2019;Lewis et al., 2020;Raffel et al., 2020).\n\nIn the dialogue domain, many models are pretrained on open-domain conversational data like Reddit. Based on GPT-2, Transfertransfo (Wolf et al., 2019b) achieves good results on ConvAI-2 competition. As another extension of GPT-2, Di-aloGPT (Zhang et al., 2020c) performs well in generating open-domain dialogue response. ConveRT ) is a language model with dual-encoder built for the task of response selection. PLATO (Bao et al., 2020) pre-trains a model with discrete latent variable structure for the response generation task.  adapts BERT with TOD pre-training and achieves strong performances on four dialogue understanding tasks.\n\nPre-training on Supplementary Data. Recent work (Phang et al., 2018;Aghajanyan et al., 2021) found that supplementary training on the tasks with intermediate-labelled data improves the performance of the fine-tuned models on GLUE natural language understanding benchmark (Wang et al., 2018). Our work studies a similar supplementary training setup with intermediate-labelled data for task-oriented dialogue systems. Unlike previous work, we use a single multi-task model for all relevant sub-tasks in task-oriented dialogue systems.\n\n "

      "full_text": "Related Work\n\nThe goal of constrained textual generation is to find the sequence of tokens x1:T which maximises p(x1:T | c), given a constraint c. Few methods address the constrained textual generation. \n\nClass-conditional language models. Classconditional language models (CC-LMs), as the Conditional Transformer Language (CTRL) model (Keskar et al., 2019), train or fine-tune the weights θ of a single neural model directly for controllable generation, by appending a control code in the beginning of a training sequence. The control code indicates the constraint to verify and is related to a class containing texts that satisfy the constraint. For the sake of simplicity, we will denote without distinction the class, the constraint verified by its texts and the associated control code by c. Trained with different control codes, the model learns pθ(x1:T | c) = ∏T t=1 pθ(xt | x1:t−1, c). The constraint can then be applied during generation by appending the corresponding control code to the prompt. While this method gives some kind of control over the generation, the control codes need to be defined upfront and the LM still needs to be trained specifically for each set of control codes. This is an important limitation since the current trend in text generation is the use of large pre-trained model which can hardly be fine-tuned (for instance, the last version of GPT, GPT-3, cannot be fine-tuned without access to very large hardware resources). Discriminator-based methods The general idea of discriminator-guided generation is to combine a disciminator D with a generative LM. The discriminator explicitly models the constraint by calculating the probability pD(c | x1:T ) of the sequence x1:T to satisfy the constraint c.  This probability is directly related to p(x1:T | c) through Bayes’ rule : p(x1:T | c) ∝ pD(c | x1:T )pθ(x1:T ). \n\nDiscriminator-based methods alleviate the training cost problem, as discriminators are easier to train than a LM. Moreover, any additional constraint can be defined a posteriori without tuning the LM, only by training another discriminator. The discriminators have been used in different ways to explore the search space. In the work of (Holtzman et al., 2018; Scialom et al., 2020), the space is first searched using beam search to generate a pool of proposals with a high likelihood pθ(x1:T ), and then the discriminator is used to re-rank them. However, in addition that beam search can miss sequences with high likelihood, it is biased towards the likelihood, while the best sequence might only have an average likelihood, but satisfies the constraint perfectly. \n\nHence, it might be more suitable to take the discriminator probability into account during decoding rather than after generating a whole sequence. In this case, the discriminator is used at each generation step to get the probability pD(c | x1:t) for each token of the vocabulary V, and merge it to the likelihood pθ(x1:t) to choose which token to emit. In order to reduce the cost of using a discriminator on every possible continuation, GeDi (Krause et al., 2020) proposes to use CC-LMs as generative discriminators. The method relies on the fact that the CC-LM computes pθ (xt | x1:t−1, c) for all tokens of the vocabulary which can be used to get pθ(c | x1:t) for all tokens using Bayes’ equation. This approach is thus at the intersection of tuning the LM and using a discriminator: it tunes a small LM (the CC-LM) to guide a bigger one. \n\nIn Plug And Play Language Model (PPLM) (Dathathri et al., 2020), the discriminator is used to shift the hidden states of the pre-trained transformer-based LM towards the desired class at every generation step. PPLM can be used on any LM and with any discriminator. However, PPLM needs to access the LM to modify its hidden states, while our approach only requires the output logits. As some LM can only be used through access to logits (e.g. GPT-3 API), this makes our approach more plug and play than PPLM. A common drawback of all these approaches is their lack of a long-term vision of the  generation. Indeed, the discriminator probabilities become necessarily more meaningful as the sequence grows and might only be trustable to guide the search when the sequence is (nearly) finished.  When used in a myopic decoding strategy, classification errors will cause the generation process to deviate further and further. Trying to optimize a score defined in the long horizon by making short term decisions is very similar to common game setups such as chess, where the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) has proven to be really effective (Silver et al., 2018), which motivated our approach.\n \n\n "

      "full_text": "Introduction\n\nText-to-SQL parsing is the task of mapping natural language questions to executable SQL queries on relational databases (Zhong et al., 2017). It provides an easy way for common users unfamiliar with query languages to access large databases and has attracted great attention. Recently, lexicological alignments, which align question phrases to their corresponding SQL query fragments, have been proved to be very helpful in improving parsing performance (Shi et al., 2020). As shown in Figure 1, the token \"competitor\" should be aligned to \"c1\" in the SQL query. To capture such alignments, several attention-based models were proposed (Shi et al., 2020;Lei et al., 2020;Liu et al., 2021), which employ the attention weights among tokens to indicate the alignments. Specifically, they use an attention module to perform schema linking at the encoding stage (Lei et al., 2020;Liu et al., 2021), and may use another attention to align each output token to its corresponding input tokens at the decoding stage (Shi et al., 2020).  However, we argue that the attention mechanism is not an appropriate way to capture and leverage lexico-logical alignments. It mainly has the following two problems. First, the standard attention can only model alignments at the token level rather than the phrase level, while there are many multi-granular, non-continuous alignments in the text-to-SQL task. For the example in Figure 1, \"order by . . . limit 1\" is a SQL keyword pattern representing a superlative operation. However, the standard attention module can only align \"order\", \"by\", \"limit\", and \"1\" to \"the longest\" token by token, rather than regarding them as a whole. It may confuse the decoder and lead to the failure to generate this pattern correctly (Herzig and Berant, 2020). Second, traditional attentionbased approaches are prone to overfitting the training data, which is harmful to the model's generalization capability. It is not only the domain generalization (Dong et al., 2019) but also the compositional generalization (Herzig and Berant, 2020).\n\nTo solve the aforementioned problems, we propose a neural parsing framework to leverage explicit lexico-logical alignments. Dong et al. (2019) have pointed out that if we align question tokens to columns or values in databases before parsing, it will help to improve the model's generalization among different domains (databases). Motivated by this, our framework consists of two steps. Specifi-cally, we first implement a simple model to obtain possible lexico-logical alignments before parsing. While in the second step, we inject such alignments into a standard seq2seq parser by treating them as additional contexts, similar to \"prompt information\" or \"evidence\" in machine reading comprehension (Mihaylov and Frank, 2018;Tu et al., 2020;Niu et al., 2020). Moreover, to alleviate the negative effects on the parser caused by noise alignments, we propose a data augmentation method that adds noisy alignments during the training procedure. Experimental results on an open-released dataset, SQUALL (Shi et al., 2020), show that our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance and obtains an absolute improvement of 3.4% compared with existing attention-based models.\n\n "

The weight adaptation methods adaptively adjust the tasks' weights during training based on pre-defined heuristic, such as uncertainty (Kendall et al., 2018), task difficulty prioritization (Guo et al., 2018), gradient normalization (Chen et al., 2018), weight average (Liu et al., 2019) and task variance regularization (Mao et al., 2021). These methods only use training losses or their gradients to compute task weights while ignores the gap between the training loss and generalization loss.\n\nBesides, the PO-based methods formulate MTL as a multi-objective optimization problem and aim to find an arbitrary Pareto stationary solution (Sener and Koltun, 2018;Mahapatra and Rajan, 2020;Lin et al., 2020;Mao et al., 2020). However, in these methods, the learning objectives only involve training losses; thus, they can only achieve Pareto stationary points w.r.t training losses. They also ignore the gap between the training loss and generalization loss. Moreover,  proposes that the PO-based methods can be also regarded as weight adaptation methods for they optimize the weighted sum of training losses as well.\n\nOverlooking the gap between the training loss and generalization loss would degenerate the performance of MTL.

In terms of model architecture, Devlin et al. (2019) focus on exhaustive cross-correlation between sentences by taking a concatenated text of two sentences as an input, while Reimers and Gurevych (2019) improve scalability based on a Siamese network and Humeau et al. (2020) adopt a hybrid approach. Along with the progress of model architectures, many advanced objectives for STS tasks were proposed as well. Specifically, Reimers and Gurevych (2019) mainly use the classification objective for an NLI dataset, and Wu et al. (2020) adopt contrastive learning to utilize self-supervision from a large corpus. Yan et al. (2021); Gao et al. (2021) incorporate a parallel corpus such as NLI datasets into their contrastive learning framework.\n\nDespite their effectiveness, the interpretability of the above models for STS tasks was not fully explored (Belinkov and Glass, 2019). One related task is interpretable STS, which aims to predict chunk alignment between two sentences . For this task, a variety of supervised approaches were proposed based on neural networks (Konopík et al., 2016;, linear programming (Tekumalla and Jat, 2016), and pretrained models (Maji et al., 2020). However, these methods cannot predict the similarity between sentences because they focus on finding chunk alignment only. To the best of our knowledge, no previous approaches based on a pretrained model have taken into account both sentence similarity and interpretation.\n\nOptimal transport\n\nOptimal transport (Monge, 1781) has been successfully adopted in natural language processing due to its ability to find a plausible correspondence between two objects (Li et al., 2020;. For example, Kusner et al. (2015) adopt optimal transport to measure the distance between two documents with pretrained word vectors. In addition, Swanson et al. (2020) discover the rationale in textmatching via optimal transport, thereby improving model interpretability.\n\nOne well-known limitation of optimal transport is that finding the optimal solution is computationally intensive, and thus approximation schemes for this problem have been extensively researched (Grauman and Darrell, 2004;Shirdhonkar and Jacobs, 2008). To get the solution efficiently, Cuturi (2013) provides a regularizer inspired by a probabilistic theory and then uses Sinkhorn's algorithm. Kusner et al.

      "full_text": "Introduction\n\nAlthough masked language models build contextualized word representations, they are pre-trained with losses that minimize distance to uncontextualized word embeddings (Peters et al., 2018;Devlin et al., 2019;Liu et al., 2019). In this paper, we introduce Question Answering Infused Pre-training (QUIP), a new pre-training loss based on question answering (QA) that depends much more directly on context, and learns improved token-level representations for a range of zero-and few-shot tasks.\n\nOur intuition for QUIP is that the contextualized representation for a phrase in a passage should contain enough information to identify all the questions that the phrase could answer in context. For example, in Figure 1, the representation for Johannes Brahms should be similar to the representation of all questions it can answer, such as \"Who wrote the violin concerto?\" We anticipate that optimizing passage representations for QA should benefit many downstream tasks, as question-answer pairs have been used as broad-coverage meaning representations (He et al., 2015; Michael et al., 2018), and a wide range of NLP tasks can be cast as QA problems (Levy et al., 2017; McCann et al., 2018; Gardner et al., 2019), For instance, our learned representations should encode whether a phrase answers a question like “Why was the movie considered good?”, which corresponds to identifying rationales for sentiment analysis.\n\nWe train QUIP with a bi-encoder extractive QA objective. The bi-encoder model independently encodes passages and questions such that the representation of each phrase in a passage is similar to the representation of reading comprehension questions answered by that phrase. To train this model, we use a question generation model to synthesize 80 million QA examples, then train the bi-encoder to match the predictions of a cross-encoder QA\nmodel, which processes the passage and question together, on these examples. Bi-encoder QA has been used before for efficient open-domain QA via phrase retrieval (Seo et al., 2018, 2019; Lee et al., 2020, 2021), but its lower accuracy compared to cross-encoder QA has previously been viewed as a drawback. We instead view the relative weakness of bi-encoder QA as an opportunity to improve contextual representations via knowledge distillation, as self-training can be effective when the student model must solve a harder problem than the teacher (Xie et al., 2020). In particular, since the bi-encoder does not know the question when encoding the passage, it must produce a single passage representation that simultaneously encodes the answers to all possible questions. In contrast, while\ncross-encoder QA models are more accurate, they depend on a specific question when encoding a passage; thus, they are less suited to downstream use cases that require contextualized representations of passages in isolation.\n\nWe show that QUIP token-level representations are useful in a variety of zero-shot and few-shot learning settings, both because the representations directly encode useful contextual information, and because we can often reduce downstream tasks to QA. For few-shot paraphrase detection, QUIP with BERTScore-based features (Zhang et al., 2020)\noutperforms prior work by 9 F1 points across four datasets. For few-shot named entity recognition (NER), QUIP combined with an initialization scheme that uses question embeddings improves over RoBERTa-large by 14 F1 across two\ndatasets. Finally, for zero-shot sentiment analysis, QUIP with question prompts improves over RoBERTa-large with MLM-style prompts by 5 accuracy points across three datasets, and extracts interpretable rationales as a side effect. Through ablations, we show that using real questions, a strong teacher model, and the bi-encoder architecture are all crucial to the success of QUIP. We will release code to reproduce all results upon publication.\n\n "

As a result, V&L research has changed its focus from task-specific architectures to fine-tuning large V&L models.\n\nCurrent benchmarks give a good perspective on model performance on a wide range of V&L tasks Lourie et al., 2021;Li et al., 2021), but the field is only starting to assess why models perform so well and whether models learn specific capabilities that span multiple V&L tasks. Specifically, we lack detailed understanding of the extent to which such models are able to ground linguistic phenomena-from morphosyntax to semantics-in the visual modality (Bernardi and Pezzelle, 2021). For example, recent evidence suggests that models are insensitive to linguistic distinctions of verb-argument structure (Hendricks and Nematzadeh, 2021) and word order (Cirik et al., 2018;Akula et al., 2020).\n\nOur work addresses this gap with VALSE (Vision And Language Structured Evaluation), a benchmark for V&L model evaluation comprising six tasks, or 'pieces', where each piece has the same structure: given a visual input, a model is asked to distinguish real captions from foils, where a foil is constructed from a caption by altering a word or phrase that realizes a specific linguistic phenomenon, e.g., semantic number of nouns, verb argument structure, or coreference. VALSE uses a resource-lean diagnostic setup that dispenses with large-scale annotation (e.g., of bounding boxes), and builds on existing high-quality image captioning and VQA data. VALSE is designed to leverage the existing prediction heads in pretrained (or finetuned) V&L models; for that reason, our benchmark does not include any re-training and can be interpreted as a zero-shot evaluation.

Tasks include multimodal masked modeling-where words in the text and object labels or regions in the image are masked out, then predictedand image-sentence alignment, whereby a model learns to predict whether an image and a text correspond. Major architectures are single-and dualstream multimodal transformers: single-stream models concatenate word and image features, and encode the resulting sequence with a single transformer stack; dual-stream models use distinct transformer stacks to handle visual and textual inputs, and additional layers (e.g. co-attention) to fuse these into multimodal features.\n\nBenchmarking V&L models V&L models (Li et al., 2019;Lu et al., 2019;Tan and Bansal, 2019;Lu et al., 2020;Li et al., 2020b;Kim et al., 2021) are commonly evaluated on V&L tasks such as VQA (Goyal et al., 2017), visual reasoning (Suhr et al., 2019), or image retrieval (Lin et al., 2014;Plummer et al., 2015). Given how well transformer-based models perform across unimodal and multimodal tasks, research efforts have recently started to address what makes them so effective, and to what extent they learn generalisable representations. Techniques to address these questions in unimodal and multimodal V&L contexts include: adversarial examples (Jia and Liang, 2017;Jia et al., 2019); investigation of the impact of bias, be it linguistic (Gururangan et al., 2018), visual semantic (Agarwal et al., 2020), or socio-economic (Garg et al., 2019); and the use of linguistically-informed counterfactual and minimally-edited examples (Levesque et al., 1 We release our dataset containing all annotators' votes (Prabhakaran et al., 2021) and code upon acceptance. 2012; Gardner et al., 2020). A trend within the latter research line that is specific to V&L models is vision-and-language foiling (Shekhar et al., 2017b;Gokhale et al., 2020;Bitton et al., 2021;Parcalabescu et al., 2021;Rosenberg et al., 2021), where the idea is to create counterfactual (i.e., foiled) and/or minimally edited examples by performing data augmentation on captions (Shekhar et al., 2017b,a) or images (Rosenberg et al., 2021).\n\nSince most V&L models are pretrained on some version of the image-text alignment task, it is possible to test their ability to distinguish correct from foiled captions (in relation to an image) in a zeroshot setting. The construction of foils can serve many investigation purposes. With VALSE, we target the linguistic grounding capabilities of V&L models, focusing on pervasive linguistic phenomena that span multiple tokens, described in §3.1- §3.6. At the same time, we ensure that our data is robust to perturbations and artefacts by i) controlling for word frequency biases between captions and foils, and ii) testing against unimodal collapse, a known issue of V&L models (Goyal et al., 2017;Madhyastha et al., 2018), thereby preventing models from solving the task using a single input modality. The issue of neural models exploiting data artefacts is well-known (Gururangan et al., 2018;Jia et al., 2019;Wang et al., 2020b;He et al., 2021) and methods have been proposed to uncover such effects, including gradient-based, adversarial perturbations or input reduction techniques (cf. Wallace et al., 2020). Yet, these methods are still not fully understood (He et al., 2021) and can be unreliable (Wang et al., 2020b).\n\nOur work is related to Gardner et al. (2020), who construct task-specific contrast sets for NLU.

      "full_text": "Related work\n\nThe application of NLP methods to automatic LSC detection is already a rather well-developed subfield of NLP research (Tahmasebi et al., 2018;Kutuzov et al., 2018). In particular, the emergence of word embeddings as a viable way to model the distributional hypothesis in semantics (Firth, 1957) has paved the way for an application of word embeddings to LSC modeling (Kim et al., 2014;Hamilton et al., 2016b;Eger and Mehler, 2016;Yao et al., 2018). Synchronically, the meaning of a word is characterized by word embeddings in terms of the contexts it appears in. LSC is captured by training word embeddings at different time points and comparing these distributions typically using cosine distance.\n\nThe main issues in this comparison is the alignment of temporal embeddings spaces, especially for neural embeddings as these are initialized and trained stochastically, which means that separate runs -on even the same data -will yield different embeddings spaces. Thus, work has focused on the development of methods to perform alignments to make embedding spaces comparable across time (see Kutuzov et al. (2018) for an overview). As an alternative to neural embeddings, scholars have also used purely count-based measures, which are naturally aligned across dimensions. Normalisation techniques are also applied, e.g. based on positive pointwise mutual information (PPMI) (Hamilton et al., 2016b;Yao et al., 2018).\n\nMost studies of LSC do not rely on a control dataset against which to validate their conclusions. In Dubossarsky et al. (2017), on the contrary, it is argued that any claims about putative laws of semantic change in diachronic corpora must be evaluated against a relevant control condition. The authors propose a methodology in which a control condition is created artificially from the original diachronic text collection by reshuffling the data.\n\nNo systematic LSC is expected in the artificially developed control dataset.\n\nThe distributional hypothesis has also been proposed as an explanatory model within the domain of phonology suggesting that phonological classes are acquired through distributional information (Chomsky and Halle, 1968;Mielke, 2008). Driven by this hypothesis, recent work has focused on testing how distributional properties can be learned by phoneme embeddings (see Mayer 2020 for an overview). Silfverberg et al. (2018) investigated to what extent learned vector representations of phonemes align with their respective representations in a feature space in which dimensions are articulatory descriptors (e.g., ±plosive). Recently, Mayer (2020) has shown that phonological classes, such as long and short vowels, can be deduced from phoneme embeddings normalised using PPMI by iteratively performing PCA on candidate classes.\n\nThus, while the distributional hypothesis for phonology is well-established, one notable issue is the fact that the empirical evidence to study sound change is relatively inaccessible since it requires recorded speech or phonologically transcribed data. Simulation is therefore used as a tool for studying the underlying mechanisms of sound change by creating computational models based on linguistic theory (Wedel, 2015). Through simulation, questions pertaining to e.g., what factors influence the (in)stability of vowel systems across generations (de Boer, 2003) can be modeled by controlling the assumptions made by the model. Work on simulation ranges from implementing theoretical approaches using mathematical models (Pierrehumbert, 2001;Blythe and Croft, 2012) to iterated learning and neural networks (Hare and Elman, 1995;Beguš, 2021).\n\nWhile the output of such models can be tested empirically on what we observe at a synchronic level, they are primarily theoretically driven. In this paper, we wish to take a data-driven approach and utilize some of the methods reviewed above to track historical sound change in writing. Rather than using word embeddings as done to model lexical change, we will use character embeddings, that are better suited to the task of sound change modeling.\n\n "

      "full_text": "Introduction\n\nPretrained language models have become crucial for achieving state-of-the-art performance in modern natural language processing. In particular, multilingual language models (Conneau and Lample, 2019;Conneau et al., 2020a;Doddapaneni et al., 2021) have attracted considerable attention particularly due to their utility in cross-lingual transfer.\n\nIn zero-shot cross-lingual transfer, a pretrained encoder is fine-tuned in a single resource-rich language (typically English), and then evaluated on other languages never seen during fine-tuning. A key to solving cross-lingual transfer tasks is to obtain representations that generalize well across languages. Several studies aim to improve multilingual models with cross-lingual supervision such as bilingual word dictionaries (Conneau et al., 2020b) or parallel sentences (Conneau and Lample, 2019).\n\nAnother source of such information is the crosslingual mappings of Wikipedia entities (articles). Wikipedia entities are aligned across languages via inter-language links and the text contains numerous entity annotations (hyperlinks). With these data, models can learn cross-lingual correspondence such as the words Tokyo and 東京 refers to the same entity. Wikipedia entity annotations have been shown to provide rich cross-lingual alignment information to improve multilingual language models (Iacer Calixto and Pasini, 2021;Xiaoze Jian and Duan, 2021). However, previous studies only incorporate entity information through an auxiliary loss function during pretraining, and the models do not explicitly have entity representations used for downstream tasks.\n\nIn this study, we investigate the effectiveness of entity representations in multilingual language models. Entity representations are known to enhance language models in mono-lingual settings (Zhang et al., 2019;Peters et al., 2019;Xiong et al., 2020;Yamada et al., 2020) presumably by introducing real-world knowledge. We argue that using entity representations facilitates cross-lingual transfer by providing languageindependent features. To this end, we present a multilingual extension of LUKE (Yamada et al., 2020). The model is trained with the multilingual masked language modeling (MLM) task as well as the masked entity prediction (MEP) task with Wikipedia entity embeddings.\n\nWe investigate two ways of using the entity representations in cross-lingual transfer tasks: (1) perform entity linking for the input text, and append the detected entity tokens to the input sequence. The entity tokens are expected to provide languageindependent features to the model. We evaluate this approach with cross-lingual question answering (QA) datasets: XQuAD (Artetxe et al., 2020) and MLQA ; (2) use the entity [MASK] token from the MEP task as a language-independent feature extractor. In the MEP task, word tokens in a mention span are associated with an entity [MASK] token, the contextualized representation of which is used to train the model to predict its original identity. Here, we apply similar input formulations to tasks involving mention-span classification, relation extraction (RE) and named entity recognition (NER): the attribute of a mention or a pair of mentions is predicted using their contextualized entity [MASK] feature. We evaluate this approach with the RELX (Köksal and Özgür, 2020) and CoNLL NER (Tjong Kim Sang, 2002;Tjong Kim Sang and De Meulder, 2003) datasets.\n\nThe experimental results show that these entitybased approaches consistently outperform wordbased baselines. Our analysis reveals that entity representations provide more language-agnostic features to solve the downstream tasks.\n\nWe also explore solving a multilingual zero-shot cloze prompt task  with the entity [MASK] token. Recent studies have shown that we can address various downstream tasks by querying a language model for blanks in prompts (Petroni et al., 2019;Cui et al., 2021). Typically, the answer tokens are predicted from the model's word-piece vocabulary but here we incorporate the prediction from the entity vocabulary queried by the entity [MASK] token. We evaluate our approach with the mLAMA dataset (Kassner et al., 2021) in various languages and show that using the entity [MASK] token reduces language bias and elicits correct factual knowledge more likely than using only the word [MASK] token.\n\n "

      "full_text": "Related Work\n\nLearning from Imbalanced Data\n\nClass imbalance is a long-standing problem in machine learning tasks, posing challenges to researchers and practitioners in many domains (King and Zeng, 2001;Lu and Jain, 2003;He and Garcia, 2009;Moreo et al., 2016). Classes in real-world data often have highly skewed distribution, leading to substantial gaps between majority and minority classes. While the positive (minority) class is often of interest, the lack of positive examples makes classifiers conservative, i.e., they incline to predict all example as the negative (majority) class. This often results in a low recall of the positive class. Because only a small number of examples are predicted as positive, precision of the positive class tends to be high or unstable. Such a low-recall, high-precision pattern often hurts the F1-score, the standard metric that emphasizes a balanced precision and recall (Juba and Le, 2019). This performance pattern is observed not only in classification tasks, but also in NER tasks where named entity tokens are the minority compared to non-entity tokens (Mao et al., 2007;Kuperus et al., 2013).\n\nResearchers have proposed various techniques for imbalanced learning, including resampling and cost-sensitive learning (He and Ma, 2013). Both aim to re-balance the representation of different classes in the loss function, such that the classifier is less conservative in making positive predictions. In principle, by equating per-instance resampling frequency with per-instance cost, resampling can be implemented as cost-sensitive learning. However, resampling can be applied to models that do not support cost-sensitive learning, making it conveniently applicable to all models.\n\nResampling in Sequence Tagging Tasks\n\nResampling (and cost-sensitive learning) can be conveniently used in classification and regression tasks where a model makes pointwise predictions (a single categorical or scalar value). Each example has a clearly defined sampling rate (or cost) according to its class label. However, in sequence tagging tasks like NER (more broadly, structured prediction tasks (BakIr et al., 2007;Smith, 2011)), a model predicts multiple values for a sequence (or structured output). For sequence learning algorithms such as linear-chain conditional random fields, while the learning objective is formulated at the sequence level, the evaluation metrics are defined at the entity span level. This makes it nontrivial to determine the sampling rate (or cost) for a sequence that contains tokens from both majority and minority entity types. Simply resampling entities by stripping surrounding context is problematic as sequence tagging algorithms depend on context to make predictions. Recent works proposed to randomly or heuristically drop tokens from sentences to re-balance NER data, which had success using conditional random fields and shallow n-gram features (Akkasi, 2018;Akkasi and Varoglu, 2019;Grancharova et al., 2020). However, these methods distort the syntactic and semantic structure of complete sentences, which may generate low-quality data for models that are capable of capturing longdistance linguistic dependencies (e.g. BERT) and hurt performance of those models. In this work, we focus on resampling strategies that leaves sentences intact.\n\nLoss Functions for Imbalanced Data\n\nRecent literature proposed special loss functions for tackling data imbalance, including focal loss (Lin et al., 2017) and Dice loss (Li et al., 2019). They increase the cost of 'hard positives' where the correct label has low predicted probability and decrease the cost of 'easy negatives' where the correct label has high predicted probability. However, these loss functions do not fully address data imbalance in NER. First, the formulation does not always emphasize the loss of minority-class tokens -majority-class tokens can also be hard to classify, and minority-class tokens can also be easy to classify. Second, these loss functions only work on token-wise prediction outputs. They cannot work on sequence-level outputs generated by conditional random fields, which is commonly used in NER. Our resampling methods can be seen as estimating sentence-level losses with explicit emphasis on sentences containing minority-class tokens.\n\n "

      "full_text": "Introduction\n\nAround 200 languages in the world are signed rather than spoken, featuring their own vocabulary and grammatical structures. For example the American Sign Language (ASL) is not a mere translation of English into signs and is unrelated to the British Sign Language (BSL). This introduces many novel challenges to their automated processing. Research on Sign Language Processing (SLP) encompasses tasks such as sign language detection, i.e. recognising if and which signed language is performed (Moryossef et al., 2020) and sign language recognition (SLR) (Koller, 2020), i.e. the identification of signs either in isolation or in continuous speech. Other tasks concern the translation from signed to spoken (or written) (Camgoz et al.,2018) language or the production of signs from text (Rastgoo et al., 2021). With the recent success of deep learning-based approaches in computer vision (CV), as well as advancements in —from the CV perspective—related tasks of action and gesture recognition (Asadi-Aghbolaghi et al., 2017), SLP is gaining more attention in the CV community (Zheng et al., 2017).\n\nSome recent approaches to various SLP tasks rely on phonological features, perhaps due to the complexity of the tasks (Tornay, 2021; Metaxas et al., 2018; Gebre et al., 2013; avella et al., 2021). Surprisingly, however, little work has been carried out on explicitly modelling the phonology of signed languages. This presents a timely opportunity to investigate signed languages from a linguist’s perspective (Yin et al., 2021). In the context of signed languages, phonology typically distinguishes between manual features, such as usage, position and movement of hands and fingers, and non-manual features, such as facial expression. Sign language phonology is a matured field with well-developed\ntheoretical frameworks (Liddell and Johnson, 1989; Fenlon et al., 2017; Sandler, 2012). These phonological features, or phonemes, are drawn from a fixed inventory of possible configurations which is typically much smaller than the vocabulary of signed languages (Borg and Camilleri, 2020). For example, there is only a limited number of fingers\nthat can be used to perform a sign due to anatomical constraints. Hence, different signs share phonological properties and well performing classifiers can be used to predict those properties for signs unseen during training. This potentially holds even across different languages, because, while different languages may dictate different combinations\nof phonemes, there are also significant overlaps (Tornay et al., 2020).\n\nFinally, these phonological properties have a strong discriminatory power when determining signs. For example, in ASL-Lex (Caselli et al., 2017), a lexicon which also captures phonology information, the authors report that more than 50% of its 994 described signs have a unique combination of only six phonological properties and more than 80% of the signs share their combination with at most two other signs. By relying on additional (i.e., phonological) information from resources such as ASL-Lex, many signs can be determined from (predicted) phonological properties alone, without encountering them in training data. This is a capability that current data-driven approaches to SLR lack by design (Koller, 2020). Thus, in combination, mature approaches to phonology recognition can facilitate the development of sign language resources. This is an important task for both documenting low-resource sign languages as well as rapid developing of large-scale datasets, to fully harness data-driven CV approaches.\n\nTo spur research in this direction, we extend the preliminary work by Tavella et al. (2021) and introduce the task of Phonological Property Recognition (PPR). More specifically, this paper contributes (i) WLASLLex2001, a large-scale, automatically constructed PPR dataset, (ii) an analysis of the dataset quality, and (iii) an empirical study of the performance of different deep-learning based baselines thereon.\n\n "

      "full_text": "Introduction\n\nA common research avenue pursued these days is to train monolithic language models with billions of parameters to solve every language understanding and reasoning challenge. In contrast, humans often tackle complex tasks by breaking them down into simpler sub-tasks, and solving these by interacting with other people or automated agents whose skillsets we are familiar with. This approach allows us to learn to solve new complex tasks quickly and effectively, by building upon what's already known. Can AI systems learn to do the same?\n\nTo facilitate research in this direction, we propose a new reasoning challenge and a benchmark called COMMAQA where, in addition to the usual end-task supervision, one has access to a set of predefined AI agents with examples of their natural language inputs. Importantly, the target end-task is designed to be too difficult for current models to learn based only on end-task supervision. The goal is instead to build models that learn to solve the target task by decomposing it into sub-tasks solvable by these agents, and interacting with these agents in natural language to do so.\n\nAs a motivating example, consider the interaction depicted in Figure 1 where a system is asked to buy a book series with a certain property. The system breaks this goal down, using agent-1 (here Google Assistant) to identify the referenced book series as well as the list of books in that series, and then using agent-2 (here Amazon Alexa) to make the purchase. While both of these agents interact with the system in natural language, they have notably different skill sets, rely on privately held knowledge sources, and have been built at an enormous cost. At the same time, neither agent by itself can accomplish the original goal.\n\nAn alternative to building such a system that interacts with existing agents is to teach all requisite sub-tasks and skills to a large black-box system, say via multi-task learning Gupta et al., 2021). This, however, is not only wasteful in terms of time and resources, but often also infeasible. For example, agents such as Google Assistant and OpenAI GPT-3 use private knowledge resources and are computationally expensive to train even once. It would thus be nearly impossible to build a single system with the capabilities of both of these agents.\n\nWe note that agents need not be sophisticated AI assistants. An agent may simply be a previously developed question-answering (QA) model, a math module, a function of textual input, an image captioning system-anything the community already knows how to build. The goal is to learn to leverage existing agents for more complex tasks.\n\nTo enable the development of general systems for this task, we identify the minimal inputs that must be assumed for the task to be learnable-training data for the complex task, existing agents that together can solve the complex task, and examples of valid questions that can be asked of these agents (capturing the agents' capabilities). We build a new synthetic benchmark dataset called COMMAQA (Communicating with agents for QA), containing three complex multihop QA tasks (involving Explicit, Implicit, and Numeric reasoning) and four input QA agents that can solve these tasks.\n\nWe demonstrate that black-box models struggle on COMMAQA even when provided with auxiliary data, such as domain-relevant agent knowledge. On the other hand, a model that leverages the agents (Khot et al., 2021) can achieve very high accuracy but relies on auxiliary supervision (decomposition annotations). While it is possible to identify valid decompositions using just the endtask labels, the search space is extremely large and naïve approaches, as we show, help only with one of the datasets. COMMAQA thus serves as a new challenge for the NLP community.\n\nContributions: We (1) propose a new challenge of learning to solve complex tasks by communicating with agents; (2) develop a synthetic multi-hop QA dataset COMMAQA with three reasoning types;\n\n(3) provide auxiliary training data and a compositional generalization test set; (4) demonstrate the challenging nature of COMMAQA for black-box models; and (5) show the promise of compositional models that learn to communicate with agents.\n\n "

      "full_text": "Introduction\n\nEntities are integral to applications that require understanding natural language text such as semantic search (Inan et al., 2021;Lashkari et al., 2019), question answering (Chandrasekaran et al., 2020;Cheng and Erk, 2020) and knowledge base construction (Goel et al., 2021;Al-Moslmi et al., 2020). To this end, entity set expansion (ESE) is a crucial task that uses a textual corpus to enhance a set of seed entities (e.g., 'mini bar', 'tv unit') with new entities (e.g., 'coffee', 'clock') that belong to the same semantic concept (e.g., room features).\n\nSince training data in new domains is scarce, many existing ESE methods expand a small seed  set by learning to rank new entity candidates with limited supervision. Broadly speaking, there are two types of such low-resource ESE methods: (a) corpus-based methods (Shen et al., 2018;Huang et al., 2020a;Yu et al., 2019a) that bootstrap the seed set using contextual features and patterns, and (b) language model-based methods  that probe a pre-trained language model with prompts to rank the entity candidates.\n\nDespite the recent progress, reported success of ESE methods is largely limited to benchmarks focusing on named entities (e.g., countries, diseases) and well-written text such as Wikipedia. Furthermore, the evaluation is limited to top 10-50 predictions regardless of the actual size of the entity set. As a result, it is unclear whether the reported effectiveness of ESE methods is conditional to datasets, domains, and/or evaluation methods.\n\nIn this paper, we conduct a comprehensive study to investigate the generalizability of ESE methods in low-resource settings. Specifically, we focus on user-generated text such as customer reviews, which is widely used in many NLP applications (Li et al., 2019;Bhutani et al., 2020;Dai and Song, 2019). Due to lack of benchmarks on user-generated text, we create new benchmarks from three domains -hotels, restaurants and jobs.\n\nWe found that these benchmarks exhibit characteristics (illustrated in Figure 1) distinctive from existing benchmarks: (a) multifaceted entities (entities that belong to multiple concepts -e.g., 'venice beach' can belong to concepts location and nearby attractions); (b) non-named entities (entities that are typically noun phrases but not proper names (Paris and Suchanek, 2021) -e.g., 'coffee'); and (c) vague entities (human annotators have subjective disagreement on their concept labels -e.g., 'casino' for nearby attraction).\n\nWe found that user-generated text can have up to 10X more multifaceted entities and 2X more nonnamed entities compared to well-curated benchmarks. Furthermore, concepts that do not have well-defined semantics result in vague entities. We hypothesize that these characteristics may affect the performance of ESE methods and thus use these to profile ESE methods. 1 kg denotes the number of all correct entities of a concept.\n\n "

      "full_text": "Introduction\n\nRetrieval systems aim at retrieving the documents most relevant to the input queries, and have received substantial spotlight since they work as core elements in diverse applications, especially for open-domain question answering (QA) (Voorhees, 1999). Open-domain QA is a task of answering the question from a massive amount of documents, often requiring two components, a retriever and a reader (Chen et al., 2017;Karpukhin et al., 2020). Specifically, a retriever ranks the most questionrelated documents, and a reader answers the question using the retrieved documents.\n\nTraditional sparse retrieval approaches such as BM25 (Robertson et al., 1994) and TF-IDF rely on term-based matching, hence suffering from the vocabulary mismatch problem: the failure of retrieving relevant documents due to the lexical difference from queries. To tackle such a problem, recent research focuses on dense retrieval models to generate learnable dense representations for queries and documents with a dual encoder structure (Karpukhin et al., 2020;. Despite their recent successes, some challenges still remain in the dense retrieval scheme for a couple of reasons. First, dense retrieval models need a large amount of labeled training data for a decent performance. However, as Figure 1 shows, the proportion of labeled query-document pairs is extremely small since it is almost impossible to rely on humans for the annotations of a large document corpus. Second, in order to adapt a retrieval model to the real world, where documents constantly emerge, handling unlabeled documents that are not seen during training should obviously be considered, but remains challenging.\n\nTo automatically expand the query-document pairs, recent work generates queries from generative models (Liang et al., 2020;Ma et al., 2021) or incorporates queries from other datasets , and then generates extra pairs of augmented queries and documents. However, these query augmentation schemes have serious obvious drawbacks. First, it is infeasible to augment queries for every document in the dataset (see the number of unlabeled documents in Figure 1), since generating and pairing queries are quite costly. Second, even after obtaining new pairs, we need extra training steps to reflect the generated pairs on the retrieval model. Third, this query augmentation method does not add variations to the documents but only to the queries, thus it may be suboptimal to handle enormous unlabeled documents. Since augmenting additional queries is costly, the question is then if it is feasible to only manipulate the given query-document pairing to handle numerous unlabeled documents. To answer this question, we first visualize the embeddings of labeled and unlabeled documents. Figure 1 shows that there is no distinct distributional shift between labeled and unlabeled documents. Thus it could be effective to manipulate only the labeled documents to handle the nearby unlabeled documents as well as the labeled documents. Using this observation, we propose a novel document augmentation method for a dense retriever, which not only interpolates two different document representations associated with the labeled query (Figure 2, center), but also stochastically perturbs the representations of labeled documents with a dropout mask (Figure 2,right). One notable advantage of our scheme is that, since it manipulates only the representations of documents, our model does not require explicit annotation steps of query-document pairs, which is efficient. We refer to our overall method as Document Augmentation for dense Retrieval (DAR).\n\nWe experimentally validate our method on standard open-domain QA datasets, namely Natural Question (NQ) (Kwiatkowski et al., 2019) and Triv-iaQA (Joshi et al., 2017) (TQA), against various evaluation metrics for retrieval models. The experimental results show that our method significantly improves the retrieval performances on both the unlabeled and labeled documents. Furthermore, a detailed analysis of the proposed model shows that interpolation and stochastic perturbation positively contribute to the overall performance.\n\nOur contributions in this work are threefold: • We propose to augment documents for dense retrieval models to tackle the problem of insufficient labels of query-document pairs. • We present two novel document augmentation schemes for dense retrievers: interpolation and perturbation of document representations. • We show that our method achieves outstanding retrieval performances on both labeled and unlabeled documents on open-domain QA tasks.\n\n "

The original BERT model is trained with character-level masking (CLM). 2 A certain percentage (e.g. 15%) of tokens in the input sequence is masked and the model is learned to predict the masked tokens.\n\nIt is helpful to note that a word in the input sequence of BERT can be broken into multiple wordpiece tokens (Wu et al., 2016). 3 For example, the input sentence \"She is undeniably brilliant\" is converted to a wordpiece sequence \"She is un ##deni ##ably brilliant\", where \"##\" is a special prefix added to indicate that the token should be attached to the previous one. In this case the word \"undeniably\" is broken into three wordpieces {\"un\", \"##deni\", \"##ably\"}. In standard masked language modeling, CLM may mask any one of them. In this case, if the token \"##ably\" is masked, it is easier for the model to complete the prediction task because \"un\" and \"##deni\" are informative prompts. To address this, Whole word masking (WWM) masks all three subtokens (i.e., {\"un\", \"##deni\", \"##ably\"}) within a word at once. For Chinese, however, each token is an atomic character that cannot be broken into smaller pieces. Many Chinese words are compounds that consisting of multiple characters (Wood and Connelly, 2009). 4 For example, \"手机\" (cellphone) is a word consisting of two characters \"手\" (hand) and \"机\" (machine). Here, learning with WWM would lose the association among characters corresponding to a word.\n\nIn this work, we introduce two probing tasks to study Chinese BERT model's ability on characterlevel understanding. The first probing task is character replacement. Given a sentence and a position where the corresponding character is erroneous, the task is to replace the erroneous character with the correct one. The second probing task is character insertion. Given a sentence and the positions where a given number of characters should be inserted, the task is to insert the correct characters. We leverage the benchmark dataset on grammatical error correction (Rao et al., 2020a) and create a dataset including labels for 19,075 tokens in 10,448 sentences.\n\nWe train three baseline models based on the same text corpus of 80B characters using CLM, WWM, and both CLM and WWM, separately. We have the following major findings. (1) When one character needs to be inserted or replaced, the model trained with CLM performs the best. Moreover, the model initialized from RoBERTa (Cui et al., 2019) and trained with WWM gets worse gradually with more training steps. (2) When more than one character needs to be handled, WWM is the key to better performance. (3) When evaluating sentence-level downstream tasks, the impact of these masking strategies is minimal and the model trained with them performs comparably.\n\n "

      "full_text": "Introduction\n\nInformation extraction (IE) is a task that aims to extract information of interest from text data and represent the extracted information in a structured form. Traditional IE tasks include named entity recognition which recognizes entities and their types (Huang et al., 2015; Ma and Hovy, 2016; Lample et al., 2016; Devlin et al., 2019), relation extraction which identifies the relationships between entities (Zheng et al., 2017; Zeng et al., 2018; Zhong and Chen, 2020), etc. Since the results of IE are structured, they can be easily used by computer systems in different applications such as text mining.\n\nIn this work, we study IE in a new setting, referred to as text-to-table. First, the system receives a training dataset containing text-table pairs. Each text-table pair contains a text and a table (or tables) representing information extracted from the text. The system learns a model for information extraction. Next, the system employs the learned model to conduct information extraction from a new text and outputs the result in a table (or tables). Figure 1 gives an example of text-to-table, where the input (above) is a report of a basketball game, and the output (below) is two tables summarizing the scores of the teams and players from the input.\n\nText-to-table is unique compared to the traditional IE approaches. First, it is mainly designed to extract structured data in a complex form from a long text. As in the example in Figure 1, extraction of information is performed from the entire document. The extracted information contains multiple types of scores of teams and players in a basketball game structured in table format. Second, the schemas for extraction are implicitly included in the training data, and there is no need to explicitly define the schemas. This reduces the need for manual efforts for schema design and annotations.\n\nOur work is inspired by research on the so-called table-to-text (or data-to-text) problem, which is the task of generating a description for a given table . Table -to-text is useful in applications where the content of a table needs to be described in natural language. Thus, text-to-table can be regarded as an inverse problem of table-to-text. However, there are also differences. Most notably, their applications are different. Text-to-table can be applied to document summarization, text mining, etc.\n\nIn this work, we formalize text-to-table as a sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) task. More specifically, we translate the text into a sequence representation of a table (or tables), where the schema of the table is implicitly contained in the representation. We also build the seq2seq model on top of a pre-trained language model, which is the stateof-the-art approach for seq2seq tasks (Lewis et al., 2019;Raffel et al., 2020). Although the approach is a natural application of existing technologies, as far as we know, there has been no previous study to investigate to what extent the approach works. We also develop a new method for text-to-table within the seq2seq approach with two additional techniques, table constraint and table relation embeddings. Table constraint controls the creation of rows in a table and table relation embeddings affect the alignments between cells and their row headers and column headers. Both are to make the generated table well-formulated.\n\nThe approach to IE based on seq2seq has already been proposed. Methods for conducting individual tasks of relation extraction (Zeng et al., 2018;Nayak and Ng, 2020), named entity recognition (Chen and Moschitti, 2018;Yan et al., 2021), and event extraction (Lu et al., 2021) have been developed. Methods for jointly performing multiple tasks of named entity recognition, relation extraction, and event extraction have also been devised (Paolini et al., 2021). Most of the methods exploit suitable pre-trained models such as BERT. However, all the existing methods rely on pre-defined schemas for extraction. Moreover, their models are designed to extract information from short texts, rather than long texts, and extract information with simple structures (such as an entity and its type), rather than information with complicated structures (such as a table ).\n\nWe conduct extensive experiments on four datasets. Results show that the vanilla seq2seq model fine-tuned from BART (Lewis et al., 2019) can outperform the state-of-the-art IE models finetuned from BERT (Devlin et al., 2019;Zhong and Chen, 2020). Furthermore, results show that our proposed approach to text-to-table with the two techniques can further improve the extraction accuracies. We also summarize the challenging issues with the seq2seq approach to text-to-table for future research.\n\nOur contributions are summarized as follows:\n\n1. We propose the new task of text-to-table for IE. We derive four new datasets for the task from existing datasets. 2. We formalize the task as a seq2seq problem and propose a new method within the seq2seq approach using the techniques of Traditionally, researchers formalize the task as a language understanding problem. The state-ofthe-art methods for NER perform the task on the basis of the pre-trained language model BERT (Devlin et al., 2019). The pipeline approach to RE divides the problem into NER and relation classification, and conducts the two sub-tasks in a sequential manner (Zhong and Chen, 2020), while the end-to-end approach jointly carries out the two sub-tasks (Zheng et al., 2017;Zeng et al., 2018;. The state-of-the-art methods for EE also employ BERT and usually jointly train the models with other tasks such as NER and RE Zhang et al., 2019;Lin et al., 2020). All the methods assume the use of pre-defined schemas (e.g., entity types for NER, entity and relation types for RE, and event templates for EE). Besides, most methods are designed for extraction from short texts. Therefore, existing methods for IE cannot be directly applied to text-to-table.\n\nAnother series of related work is open information extraction (OpenIE), which aims to extract information from texts without relying on explicitly defined schemas (Banko et al., 2007;Wu and Weld, 2010;Mausam et al., 2012;Stanovsky et al., 2018;Zhan and Zhao, 2020). However, OpenIE aims to extract information with simple structures (i.e., relation tuples) from short texts, and the methods in OpenIE cannot be directly applied to text-to-table . IE is also conducted at document level, referred to as doc-level IE. For example, some NER methods directly perform NER on a long document (Strubell et al., 2017;Luo et al., 2018), and others encode each sentence in a document, use attention to fuse document-level information, and perform NER on each sentence (Hu et al., 2020;Xu et al., 2018). There are also RE methods that predict the relationships between entities in a document (Yao et al., 2019;Nan et al., 2020a). However, existing doc-level IE approaches usually do not consider extraction of complex relations between many items.\n\nSequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) is the general problem of transforming one text into another text (Sutskever et al., 2014;Bahdanau et al., 2014), which includes machine translation, text summarization, etc. The use of the pre-trained language models of BART (Lewis et al., 2019) and T5 (Raffel et al., 2020) can significantly boost the performances of seq2seq, such as machine translation (Lewis et al., 2019;Raffel et al., 2020;) and text summarization (Lewis et al., 2019;Raffel et al., 2020;.\n\nRecently, some researchers also formalize the IE problems as seq2seq, that is, transforming the input text into an internal representation. One advantage is that one can employ a single model to extract multiple types of information. Results show that this approach works better than or equally well as the traditional approach of language understanding, in RE (Zeng et al., 2018;Nayak and Ng, 2020), NER (Chen and Moschitti, 2018;Yan et al., 2021) and EE (Lu et al., 2021). Methods for jointly performing multiple tasks including NER, RE and EE have also been devised (Paolini et al., 2021).\n\nData-to-text aims to generate natural language descriptions from the input structured data such as sport commentaries (Wiseman et al., 2017). The structured data is usually represented as tables (Wiseman et al., 2017;Thomson et al., 2020;, sets of table cells (Parikh et al., 2020;Bao et al., 2018), semantic representations (Novikova et al., 2017), or sets of relation triples (Gardent et al., 2017;Nan et al., 2020b). The task requires the model to select the salient information from the data, organize it in a logical order, and generate an accurate and fluent natural language description (Wiseman et al., 2017). Data-to-text models usually adopt the encoder-decoder architecture. The encoders are specifically designed to model the input data, such as multi-layer perceptron (Puduppully et al., 2019a,b), recurrent neural network (Juraska et al., 2018;Shen et al., 2020), graph neural network (Marcheggiani and Perez-Beltrachini, 2018;Koncel-Kedziorski et al., 2019), or Transformer (Gong et al., 2019).\n\n "

LT comes with a certain drop in quality, but this drop can be compensated by using a variant of knowledge distillation (Hinton et al., 2014).\n\nOur contributions are as follows: We perform a large study on a diverse set of tasks showing that CA models and SN yield similar performance for both zero-shot and few-shot text classification.  (LT). At training time, input and label texts (hypotheses) are processed by the encoder. LT then tunes the labels using a cross entropy (CE) loss. At inference time, the input text is passed through the same encoder. The tuned label embeddings and a similarity function are then used to score each label. The encoder remains unchanged and can be shared between multiple tasks.\n\nIn contrast to most prior work, we also show that these results can also be achieved for languages other than English. We compare the hypothesis patterns commonly used in the literature and using the plain label name (null hypothesis) and find that on average there is no significant difference in performance. Finally, we present LT as an alternative to full fine-tuning that allows using the same model for many tasks and thus greatly increases the scalability of the method. We will release the code and trained models used in our experiments.\n\n "

      "full_text": "Introduction\n\nCoherence describes the semantic relation between elements of a text. It recognizes how well a text is organized to convey the information to the reader effectively. Modeling coherence can be beneficial to any system which needs to process a text.\n\nRecent neural coherence models (Mesgar and Strube, 2018;Moon et al., 2019) encode the input document using large-scale pretrained language models (Peters et al., 2018). These neural models compute local coherence, semantic relations between items in adjacent sentences, on the basis of words and even sub-words.\n\nHowever, it has been unclear on which basis these models compute local coherence. Jeon and Strube (2020) present a neural coherence model, which allows to interpret focus information for the first time. Their investigation reveals that neural models, adopting large-scale pretrained language models, frequently compute coherence on the basis of connections between any (sub-)words or function words. In these cases, the model might capture the focus based on spurious information. While such a model might reach or set the state of the art in some end applications, it will do so for the wrong reasons from a linguistic perspective.\n\nThis problem did not appear with pre-neural models of coherence, since they compute coherence on the basis of entities. Early work about pronoun and anaphora resolution by Sidner (1981Sidner ( , 1983 assumes that there is one single salient entity in a sentence, its focus, which serves as a preferred antecedent for anaphoric expressions. Centering theory (Joshi and Weinstein, 1981;Grosz et al., 1995) builds on these insights and introduces an algorithm for tracking changes in focus. Centering theory serves as basis for many researchers to develop systems computing local coherence based on the approximations of entities (Barzilay and Lapata 2008;Feng and Hirst 2012;Guinaudeau and Strube 2013, inter alia).\n\nIn this paper, we propose a neural coherence model which is linguistically more sound than previously proposed neural coherence models. We compute coherence on the basis of entities by constraining our model to capture focus on noun phrases and proper names. This provides us with an explicit representation of the most important items in sentences, leading to the notion of focus. This brings our model linguistically in line with pre-neural models of coherence.\n\nOur approach is not only linguistically more sound but also is in accord with the recent empirical study by O'Connor and Andreas (2021) who investigate what contextual information contributes to accurate predictions in transformer-based language models. Their experiments show that most usable information is captured by nouns and verbs. Their findings suggest that we can design better neural models by focusing on specific context words. Our work follows their findings by modeling entitybased coherence in an end-to-end framework to improve a neural coherence model.\n\nOur model integrates a local coherence module with a component which takes context into account. Our model first encodes a document using a pretrained language model and identifies entities using an linguistic parser. The local coherence module captures the most related representations of entities between adjacent sentences, the local focus. Then it tracks the changes of local foci. The second component captures the context of a text by averaging sentence representations.\n\nWe evaluate our model on three downstream tasks: automated essay scoring (AES), assessing writing quality (AWQ), and assessing discourse coherence (ADC). AES and AWQ determine text quality for a given text, aiming to replicate human scoring results. Since coherence is an essential factor in assessing text quality, many previous coherence models are evaluated on AES and AWQ. ADC evaluates coherence models on informal texts such as emails and online reviews. In our evaluation, our model achieves state-of-the-art performance.\n\nWe also perform a series of analyses to investigate how our model works. Our analyses show that capturing focus on entities gives us better insight into the behaviour of the model, leading to better explainability. Using this information, we examine the statistical differences of texts assigned to different qualities. From the perspective of local coherence, we find that texts of higher quality are neither semantically too consistent nor too variant. Finally, we inspect error cases to investigate how the models achieve their performance differently.\n\n "

      "full_text": "Related Work\n\nDeep learning, to a large extent, has freed data scientists from doing feature engineering, which has been one of the essential obstacles to annotation with AL. This advantage has sparked a series of works on deep active learning (DAL) in natural language processing (NLP). Shen et al. (2017) conduct one of the first investigations on DAL in sequence tagging tasks. They propose an efficient way of quantifying the uncertainty of sentences, namely maximal normalized log probability (MNLP), by averaging log probabilities of their tokens. They also address the problem of excessive duration of a neural network training step during an AL iteration by interleaving online learning with training from scratch. In our work, we take MNLP as a query strategy for experiments on sequence tagging tasks since it has demonstrated a good trade-off between quality and computational performance. We consider that online learning can potentially be used as a complement to our algorithms. Since the most time-consuming part of an AL iteration can be model inference instead of training, in this work, we also pay attention to the acceleration of the inference step.\n\nSeveral recent publications investigate deep pretrained models based on the Transformer architecture (Vaswani et al., 2017), ELMo (Peters et al., 2018), and ULMFiT (Howard and Ruder, 2018) in AL on NLP tasks (Prabhu et al., 2019;Ein-Dor et al., 2020;Yuan et al., 2020;Shelmanov et al., 2021). We continue this line of works by relying on pre-trained Transformers since this architecture has been shown promising for AL in NLP due to its good qualitative and computational performance.\n\nA few works have experimented with Bayesian query strategies for AL. Shen et al. (2017), Sid-dhant and Lipton (2018), Ein-Dor et al. (2020), and Shelmanov et al. (2021 leverage Monte Carlo dropout (Gal and Ghahramani, 2016) for quantifying uncertainty of models. Siddhant and Lipton (2018) also apply the Bayes by backprop algorithm (Blundell et al., 2015) for performing variational inference of a Bayesian neural network. This approach demonstrates the best improvements upon the baseline but introduces large computational overhead both for training and uncertainty estimation of a model, as well as the memory overhead for storing parameters of a Bayesian neural network. The query strategies based on Monte Carlo dropout do not affect the model training procedure and do not change the memory footprint. However, they also suffer from slow uncertainty estimation due to the necessity of making multiple stochastic predictions, while their empirical evaluations with Transformers in recent works (Ein-Dor et al., 2020;Shelmanov et al., 2021) do not demonstrate big advantages. Therefore, we do not use Bayesian query strategies in our experiments and adhere to the classical uncertainty-based query strategies.\n\nRecently proposed alternatives to uncertaintybased query strategies leverage reinforcement learning and imitation learning (Fang et al., 2017;Liu et al., 2018;Vu et al., 2019;Brantley et al., 2020). This series of works aims at constructing trainable policy-based query strategies. However, this requires an excessive amount of computation while the transferability of learned policies across domains and tasks is underresearched.\n\nFinally, Lowell et al. ( 2019) question the usefulness of AL techniques in general. They demonstrate that due to the ASM problem, AL can be even detrimental to the performance of the successor. This finding is also revealed for classical machine learning models by Baldridge and Osborne (2004), Tomanek andMorik (2011), Hu et al. (2016) and supported by experiments with Transformers in (Shelmanov et al., 2021). Our work directly addresses the question raised by Lowell et al. (2019) and suggests a simple solution to the ASM problem. Moreover, we combine it with the method proposed by Shelmanov et al. (2021), who suggest using distilled models for instance acquisition and their teacher models as successors.\n\n "

The focus of most of these works, however, has been on learning for a single language (often English). Prior work on AL that uses a multilingual setup or cross-lingual information sharing and that goes beyond training a separate model for each language has thus been limited. The closest work where multiple languages influence each other's acquisition is that of Qian et al. (2014); however, they still train a separate model for each language.\n\nFor transfer to multiple languages, recent advances in building MPLMs (Devlin et al., 2019;Conneau et al., 2020;Liu et al., 2020;Xue et al., 2020) have been extremely effective, especially in zero-shot transfer (Pires et al., 2019;Liu et al., 2020).

Human feedback has been studied as a direct learning signal for NMT (Kreutzer et al., 2018b;Mendoncca et al., 2021), semantic parsing (Lawrence and Riezler, 2018), summarization (Stiennon et al., 2020), and dialogue (Jaques et al., 2020). Nguyen et al. (2017) simulates bandit feedback to improve an MT system fully trained on a large annotated dataset, including analyzing robustness to feedback perturbations. Our work shows that simulated bandit feedback is an effective learning signal for extractive question answering tasks. Our work differs in focus on reducing annotation costs by relying on few annotated examples only to train the initial model, or by eliminating the need for in-domain annotation completely by relying on data in other domains to train initial models. Alternative forms of supervision for QA have been explored in prior work, such as explicitly providing fine-grained information (Dua et al., 2020;Khashabi et al., 2020a). Kratzwald et al. (2020) resembles our setting in that it seeks binary feed-back to replace span annotation, but their goal is to create supervised data more economically.

      "full_text": "Related Work\n\nThe KILT benchmark and public leaderboard combines eleven datasets across five tasks. The main advantage of the KILT distribution of these datasets is that the provenance information from each dataset is realigned to reference the same snapshot of Wikipedia. A unified evaluation script and set of metrics is also provided. In this work, we focus on four tasks, such as Slot Filling [Levy et al., 2017, Elsahar et al., 2018, Question Answering [Kwiatkowski et al., 2019, Joshi et al., 2017, Fact Checking [Thorne et al., 2018a,c], and Dialog [Dinan et al., 2019] (see Figure 1). A set of baseline methods have been proposed for KILT. GENRE [Cao et al., 2021] is trained on BLINK  and all KILT tasks jointly using a sequence-to-sequence language model to generate the title of the Wikipedia page where the answer can be found. This method is a strong baseline to evaluate the retrieval performance, but it does not address the downstream tasks. On the other hand, generative models, such as BART [Lewis et al., 2020a] and T5 [Raffel et al., 2020], show interesting performance when finetuned on the downstream tasks relying only on the implicit knowledge stored in the weights of the neural networks, without the use of any explicit retrieval component.\n\nRAG [Lewis et al., 2020b], an end-to-end retrieval-based generative model, is the best performing baseline in KILT and it incorporates DPR [Karpukhin et al., 2020] to first retrieve relevant passages for the query, then it uses a model initialized from BART [Lewis et al., 2020a] to perform a sequence-to-sequence generation from each evidence passage concatenated with the query in order to generate the answer. Figure 2 shows the architecture of RAG.\n\nMulti-task DPR  exploits multi-task learning by training both DPR passage and query encoder on all KILT tasks. DensePhrases [Lee et al., 2021] addresses the knowledge intensive tasks with a short answer, such as slot filling. It indexes the phrases in the corpus that can be potential answers. The extracted phrases are represented by their start and end token vectors from the final layer of a transformer initialized from SpanBERT [Joshi et al., 2020].\n\nKnowledge Graph Induction (KGI) [Glass et al., 2021] combines DPR and RAG models, both trained with task and dataset specific training. KGI employs a two phase training procedure: first training the DPR model, i.e. both the query and context encoder, using the KILT provenance ground truth. Then, KGI trains the sequence-to-sequence generation and further trains the query encoder using only the target output as the objective. This results in large improvements in retrieval performance and, as a consequence, in the downstream tasks.\n\nMulti-stage or cascade approaches to retrieval have received ample attention in Information Retrieval (IR) research. The multi-stage approach begins with the initial retrieval phase, where an initial set of documents or passages form the pool of candidates to be considered for ranking. Then one or more phases of increasingly computationally demanding rerankers are applied. Early approaches in learning to rank [Liu, 2009] used features and linear classifiers. Pre-trained language models, especially BERT , have shown state-ofthe-art performance when applied to the task of relevance ranking. Transformers may be applied as classifiers to each query and passage pair independently [Nogueira and Cho, 2019] or as generators to produce labels for passages in a sequence-tosequence model [Nogueira et al., 2020].\n\n "

Despite human evaluation being carried out by experts inter-annotator agreement levels varied depending on criteria being measured, ranging from as low as 0.298. Additionally, although correlations between human assessments are reported as significant at p < 0.01, despite such statistics often being reported for correlations, they are unfortunately not very meaningful in terms of their impact on correlation interpretation and can be somewhat misleading. Contrary to common expectations, even small effect sizes (low r) can produce very low p-values (strong significance) in such tests.

In an additional effort to evaluate models, conversational user experience, coherence, engagement, domain coverage, topical diversity, and conversational depth were assessed (1-5 scale), with combined scores reported to correlate with those of general users at r = 0.66. In addition to methods and data not being publicly available, correlations are difficult to interpret since no detail is provided about the number of judgments on which the correlation is calculated for example.\n\nIn addition to competitions that generally aim to include human evaluation of systems, automatic metrics are often proposed for dialogue evaluation, themselves requiring a human evaluation data set on which to evaluate the proposed metric. How-ever, inappropriate statistics are often applied. For example, Pang et al. (2020) propose a holistic metric to automatically evaluate four distinct aspects of dialogue, and a human evaluation experiment is deployed on Mechanical Turk using a 1-5 rating scale. The mean correlation between human assessors is reported as r = 0.61. However, mean correlations are unfortunately difficult to interpret, since correlation coefficients are not additive , averages calculated in the usual way cannot be assumed to reflect central tendency, and unfortunately, the distribution of correlations is not reported (Alexander, 1990). Mehri and Eskenazi (2020b) propose USR (Un-Supervised and Reference-free), an unsupervised model that predicts the quality of dialog for a range of criteria using various rating scales: understandable (0-1 rating scale), natural (1-3), maintains context (1-3), interesting (1-3), uses knowledge (0-1); overall quality (1-5). Despite human evaluation being carried out by experts inter-annotator agreement levels varied depending on criteria being measured, ranging from as low as 0.298. Additionally, although correlations between human assessments are reported as significant at p < 0.01, despite such statistics often being reported for correlations, they are unfortunately not very meaningful in terms of their impact on correlation interpretation and can be somewhat misleading. Contrary to common expectations, even small effect sizes (low r) can produce very low p-values (strong significance) in such tests. Aiming to achieve a significant correlation is an extremely low bar to reach in terms of consistency, since a low p-value in this case simply rejects the null hypothesis that the correlation is zero.\n\nIn addition to the above issues, human evaluation of dialogue systems rarely take into account the fact that differences in performance can occur simply by chance. The method of human evaluation we propose provides a means of applying standard tests for statistical significance to avoid concluding differences that are highly likely to have occurred simply by chance.\n\n "
